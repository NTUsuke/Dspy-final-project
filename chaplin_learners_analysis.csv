He looks up to the window from where the trash was thrown out and picks the baby up.  <br/>  <br/> Right behind him arrives a woman with a Buggy. She seems to look for something.Chaplin tries to get her attention, while she is returning from entering a house entrance he sets the baby into the buggy to the other kid. The woman is furious and tells him after Chaplin wants to leave her with both kids in the buggy to take the kid back and he eventually does that and walks away. <br/>  <br/> Chaplin arrives at the spot where he found the baby and put it back while a policeman arrived behind him seriously scanning the Situation. Chaplin turning around and almost stumbling into the policeman returns to the baby, picks it up and walks around the corner and finds an elderly man with a walking stick. Chaplin puts the baby in his arms and fastly walks away after pretending he needs to tie up his shoe. <br/>  <br/> The elderly man quickly walks with the baby around the corner just to find a buggy with another kid inside where he places the baby and disappears. After he is gone the woman from before steps out of the entrance and looks at the buggy, gets annoyed and is likely to look for Charlie Chaplin who encounters again the police man and eventually passes without any reaction. She follows him, hits him with her umbrella and drags him back to the buggy. They argue about the baby when the policeman joints the situation. Finally, Chaplin takes the baby out of the buggy and walks away, so do the others.  <br/>  <br/> Chaplin sits on the sidewalk thinking about putting the baby into a duct but then he rolls back.  <br/> He looks at the baby and finds a note saying that this baby is an orphan and needs love and care.  <br/> He smiles at the baby in his arms, gets up and walks away with it.		{'Charlie': 2, 'Chaplin': 11, 'is': 7, 'walking': 2, 'down': 1, 'a': 12, 'street': 1, 'with': 8, 'quite': 1, 'shabby': 1, 'looking': 1, 'houses': 1, 'when': 2, 'he': 9, 'suddenly': 1, 'got': 1, 'hit': 1, 'by': 1, 'some': 1, 'trash': 3, 'that': 3, 'seemed': 1, 'to': 15, 'be': 1, 'thrown': 2, 'out': 4, 'of': 3, 'window': 2, '(': 1, 'which': 1, 'not': 1, 'visible': 1, 'the': 39, 'audience': 1, 'in': 5, 'screen': 1, ')': 1, 'and': 21, 'should': 1, 'have': 1, 'fallen': 1, 'into': 5, 'waste': 1, 'can': 1, 'next': 1, '.': 18, '<': 12, 'br/': 12, '>': 12, ' ': 9, 'lights': 1, 'another': 2, 'cigarette': 1, ',': 8, 'throws': 1, 'his': 4, 'gloves': 1, 'looks': 4, 'other': 2, 'side': 1, 'where': 4, 'finds': 3, 'baby': 14, 'covered': 1, 'blanket': 1, 'lying': 1, 'on': 2, 'Floor': 1, 'He': 3, 'up': 5, 'from': 3, 'was': 1, 'picks': 2, 'Right': 1, 'behind': 2, 'him': 6, 'arrives': 2, 'woman': 3, 'Buggy': 1, 'She': 2, 'seems': 1, 'look': 2, 'for': 2, 'something': 1, 'tries': 1, 'get': 1, 'her': 3, 'attention': 1, 'while': 2, 'she': 1, 'returning': 1, 'entering': 1, 'house': 1, 'entrance': 2, 'sets': 1, 'buggy': 6, 'kid': 3, 'The': 2, 'furious': 1, 'tells': 1, 'after': 2, 'wants': 1, 'leave': 1, 'both': 1, 'kids': 1, 'take': 1, 'back': 4, 'eventually': 2, 'does': 1, 'walks': 6, 'away': 4, 'at': 4, 'spot': 1, 'found': 1, 'put': 1, 'it': 3, 'policeman': 3, 'arrived': 1, 'seriously': 1, 'scanning': 1, 'Situation': 1, 'turning': 1, 'around': 3, 'almost': 1, 'stumbling': 1, 'returns': 1, 'corner': 2, 'an': 2, 'elderly': 2, 'man': 3, 'stick': 1, 'puts': 1, 'arms': 2, 'fastly': 1, 'pretending': 1, 'needs': 2, 'tie': 1, 'shoe': 1, 'quickly': 1, 'just': 1, 'find': 1, 'inside': 1, 'places': 1, 'disappears': 1, 'After': 1, 'gone': 1, 'before': 1, 'steps': 1, 'gets': 2, 'annoyed': 1, 'likely': 1, 'who': 1, 'encounters': 1, 'again': 1, 'police': 1, 'passes': 1, 'without': 1, 'any': 1, 'reaction': 1, 'follows': 1, 'hits': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'drags': 1, 'They': 1, 'argue': 1, 'about': 2, 'joints': 1, 'situation': 1, 'Finally': 1, 'takes': 1, 'so': 1, 'do': 1, 'others': 1, 'sits': 1, 'sidewalk': 1, 'thinking': 1, 'putting': 1, 'duct': 1, 'but': 1, 'then': 1, 'rolls': 1, 'note': 1, 'saying': 1, 'this': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'love': 1, 'care': 1, 'smiles': 1}	{'PROPN': 26, 'AUX': 13, 'VERB': 76, 'ADP': 59, 'DET': 61, 'NOUN': 71, 'ADV': 24, 'ADJ': 10, 'SCONJ': 11, 'PRON': 37, 'PART': 9, 'PUNCT': 28, 'CCONJ': 22, 'X': 24, 'SPACE': 9}

A few seconds later after smoking a cigarette, he discovers a child lying on the floor. He picks it up and searches for the mother. Afterwards, a mother with a child passes by. Chaplin thinks, that she might be the mother of the child. But that is not the case, because she denies being the mother. This leads to Chaplin laying the child back down where he found it, until a police officer appears. Without wanting to leave a bad impression, he picks up the child again and runs away, until he gives it to a homeless person on the way. The homeless person lays the child in a baby buggy, which belongs to the mother from a few moments ago. Of course there is no other than Charlie Chaplin who appears afterwards, which leads to the mother beating him up. The policeman appears afterwards as well, so Chaplin has to leave again with the baby. Sitting on the street with the kid, Chaplin discovers a letter and gets to know that the child has been abandoned by its parents. Finally, one can see Chaplin smiling towards the orphan holding it.		{'In': 1, 'the': 18, 'following': 1, 'clip': 1, ',': 13, 'one': 2, 'can': 2, 'see': 2, 'Charlie': 2, 'Chaplin': 7, 'going': 1, 'through': 1, 'a': 11, 'street': 2, '.': 13, 'A': 1, 'few': 2, 'seconds': 1, 'later': 1, 'after': 1, 'smoking': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'he': 4, 'discovers': 2, 'child': 7, 'lying': 1, 'on': 3, 'floor': 1, 'He': 1, 'picks': 2, 'it': 4, 'up': 3, 'and': 3, 'searches': 1, 'for': 1, 'mother': 6, 'Afterwards': 1, 'with': 3, 'passes': 1, 'by': 2, 'thinks': 1, 'that': 3, 'she': 2, 'might': 1, 'be': 1, 'of': 1, 'But': 1, 'is': 2, 'not': 1, 'case': 1, 'because': 1, 'denies': 1, 'being': 1, 'This': 1, 'leads': 2, 'to': 7, 'laying': 1, 'back': 1, 'down': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'until': 2, 'police': 1, 'officer': 1, 'appears': 3, 'Without': 1, 'wanting': 1, 'leave': 2, 'bad': 1, 'impression': 1, 'again': 2, 'runs': 1, 'away': 1, 'gives': 1, 'homeless': 2, 'person': 2, 'way': 1, 'The': 2, 'lays': 1, 'in': 1, 'baby': 2, 'buggy': 1, 'which': 2, 'belongs': 1, 'from': 1, 'moments': 1, 'ago': 1, 'Of': 1, 'course': 1, 'there': 1, 'no': 1, 'other': 1, 'than': 1, 'who': 1, 'afterwards': 2, 'beating': 1, 'him': 1, 'policeman': 1, 'as': 1, 'well': 1, 'so': 1, 'has': 2, 'Sitting': 1, 'kid': 1, 'letter': 1, 'gets': 1, 'know': 1, 'been': 1, 'abandoned': 1, 'its': 1, 'parents': 1, 'Finally': 1, 'smiling': 1, 'towards': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'holding': 1}	{'ADP': 25, 'DET': 33, 'ADJ': 8, 'NOUN': 34, 'PUNCT': 26, 'PRON': 21, 'AUX': 8, 'VERB': 36, 'PROPN': 9, 'ADV': 16, 'CCONJ': 4, 'SCONJ': 6, 'PART': 4}

In the first sequence one can see Charlie Chaplin lighting a cigarette. By doing so he suddenly notices a baby besides the bins on the ground. He is not able to identify the parents of the baby. As he sees a woman passing by with a stroller, he suggests that it could be the mother of the baby. So he layed the baby in to the stroller. It turned out that it was not her baby. As a consequence she started mocking at Charlie, so he had to take it out of the stroller again. As he had no other idea where to place down the baby, he layed it back to the place he found the baby. But this move failed again. A officer cought him laying down the baby on the floor so he had to pick up the baby again. Once more he is disperately thinking of an other option. He encounters an old man, which he could hand over the baby with a ruse and flees right afterwards. This olderly man then sees the woman with the stroller, and puts it in the stroller as Charlie had done before. Therfore the woman suggested Charlie the one ho had put the baby in her stroller as Charlie crossed her way. She hits him with a umbrella and gives him back the baby. Charlie gives up and now realises that it is  an orphan baby as he finds a small letter which says to please take care of that orphan baby.		{'The': 1, 'short': 1, 'movie': 1, 'is': 4, 'about': 1, 'Charlie': 7, 'Chaplin': 2, 'finding': 1, 'a': 9, 'baby': 15, 'and': 5, 'searching': 1, 'for': 1, 'its': 1, 'parents': 2, '.': 17, 'In': 1, 'the': 24, 'first': 1, 'sequence': 1, 'one': 2, 'can': 1, 'see': 1, 'lighting': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'By': 1, 'doing': 1, 'so': 3, 'he': 12, 'suddenly': 1, 'notices': 1, 'besides': 1, 'bins': 1, 'on': 2, 'ground': 1, 'He': 2, 'not': 2, 'able': 1, 'to': 7, 'identify': 1, 'of': 5, 'As': 3, 'sees': 2, 'woman': 3, 'passing': 1, 'by': 1, 'with': 4, 'stroller': 6, ',': 5, 'suggests': 1, 'that': 4, 'it': 6, 'could': 2, 'be': 1, 'mother': 1, 'So': 1, 'layed': 2, 'in': 3, 'It': 1, 'turned': 1, 'out': 2, 'was': 1, 'her': 3, 'consequence': 1, 'she': 1, 'started': 1, 'mocking': 1, 'at': 1, 'had': 5, 'take': 2, 'again': 3, 'no': 1, 'other': 2, 'idea': 1, 'where': 1, 'place': 2, 'down': 2, 'back': 2, 'found': 1, 'But': 1, 'this': 1, 'move': 1, 'failed': 1, 'A': 1, 'officer': 1, 'cought': 1, 'him': 3, 'laying': 1, 'floor': 1, 'pick': 1, 'up': 2, 'Once': 1, 'more': 1, 'disperately': 1, 'thinking': 1, 'an': 3, 'option': 1, 'encounters': 1, 'old': 1, 'man': 2, 'which': 2, 'hand': 1, 'over': 1, 'ruse': 1, 'flees': 1, 'right': 1, 'afterwards': 1, 'This': 1, 'olderly': 1, 'then': 1, 'puts': 1, 'as': 3, 'done': 1, 'before': 1, 'Therfore': 1, 'suggested': 1, 'ho': 1, 'put': 1, 'crossed': 1, 'way': 1, 'She': 1, 'hits': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'gives': 2, 'now': 1, 'realises': 1, ' ': 1, 'orphan': 2, 'finds': 1, 'small': 1, 'letter': 1, 'says': 1, 'please': 1, 'care': 1}	{'DET': 42, 'ADJ': 9, 'NOUN': 48, 'AUX': 12, 'ADP': 29, 'PROPN': 10, 'VERB': 43, 'CCONJ': 6, 'PRON': 33, 'PUNCT': 22, 'ADV': 17, 'SCONJ': 11, 'PART': 7, 'NUM': 1, 'SPACE': 1}

Chaplin	written_online	20.0	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (German/English)	Charlie Chaplin walks through the streets while some residents throw trash outside their windows. Suddenly he gets hit by some of the trash a neighbour threw out and complained. As he looked down to clean himself up and light another cigar, he notices the babys cries and lift it up. In the exact moment a woman with a stroller and her own baby walks into the background of the scene, Chaplin thought that she might accidently lost her child and wanted to return it. He put the baby he just found into the stroller and implied that she dropped something, the mother reacts furious and wants him to take the baby and leave. As he walked back to the spot where he had found the baby, a police officer walked in. Chaplin notices him and picks the baby up again because he didn't want to get into trouble for abandoning the baby. He walks around the corner and notices an older man,  suddenly he had an idea how to get rid of the child for his own sake. He asked the man to hold the baby while he ties his shoe laces, he agreed and as soon as he seemed distracted Chaplin ran away. He hid in a parking lot, confused the older man searches for him and came across the stroller with a baby inside and just laid the baby he just recieved inside. As Chaplin wanted to leave the scene, the Police Officer appeared again and he knowingly avoids him. Thus he walks by the woman with the stroller, that noticed that the baby was inside her stroller again, she assumed that Chaplin had dropped it in there again and furiously attacks him with her umbrella. Angrily she drags him to the stroller and shouts at him, that he should take the baby and leave. Once again the police officer stepped into the scene and the woman seems to try to get his help but decided just to leave. Chaplin leaves the scene as well and decided to sit down on the roadside with the baby on his lap. He contemplates wherever he should get rid of the baby and looked suspiciously into the sewerage. He declined that thought and turned the baby into another position in his arms and notices a small letter in which is written that this baby is a orphan, a child without living parents and that someone should take care for the baby and treat it with love. As he realised the sad fate of this baby, he smiled at it and interacted with it quite caring and leaves the scene.

After that he finds a lonely baby in a corner while he just started smoking a cigarette. He decides to pick up the baby and discovers a mother with a baby carriage and a child in it. He thought the baby belongs to her so he puts him in the stroller. The mother gets upset telling him to take his baby back. So he took the baby back and placed it right where he found him but this time a police officer walks by. He takes the baby again back and walks around with him until he finds another person. He gives the baby in his arms and runs away. The guy with the baby finds the mother with the stroller as well and so he puts the baby in it and walks away. Charles now randomly walks by the baby carriage as the mother sees the random baby in it again. She hits Charles a few times and force him to take the baby out by speaking to the police officer. So he picks the baby back up and sits at a roadside. There he finds a paper which was hidden in the clothing of the baby. It leads to him being happy and deciding to keep the baby.		{'Charles': 3, 'walks': 5, 'down': 1, 'a': 11, 'street': 1, 'trying': 1, 'to': 8, 'dodge': 1, 'trash': 1, 'that': 2, 'people': 1, 'throw': 1, 'out': 2, 'of': 2, 'their': 1, 'windows': 1, '.': 14, 'After': 1, 'he': 9, 'finds': 4, 'lonely': 1, 'baby': 16, 'in': 7, 'corner': 1, 'while': 1, 'just': 1, 'started': 1, 'smoking': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'He': 4, 'decides': 1, 'pick': 1, 'up': 2, 'the': 19, 'and': 10, 'discovers': 1, 'mother': 4, 'with': 4, 'carriage': 2, 'child': 1, 'it': 4, 'thought': 1, 'belongs': 1, 'her': 1, 'so': 2, 'puts': 2, 'him': 6, 'stroller': 2, 'The': 2, 'gets': 1, 'upset': 1, 'telling': 1, 'take': 2, 'his': 2, 'back': 4, 'So': 2, 'took': 1, 'placed': 1, 'right': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'but': 1, 'this': 1, 'time': 1, 'police': 2, 'officer': 2, 'by': 3, 'takes': 1, 'again': 2, 'around': 1, 'until': 1, 'another': 1, 'person': 1, 'gives': 1, 'arms': 1, 'runs': 1, 'away': 2, 'guy': 1, 'as': 2, 'well': 1, 'now': 1, 'randomly': 1, 'sees': 1, 'random': 1, 'She': 1, 'hits': 1, 'few': 1, 'times': 1, 'force': 1, 'speaking': 1, 'picks': 1, 'sits': 1, 'at': 1, 'roadside': 1, 'There': 1, 'paper': 1, 'which': 1, 'was': 1, 'hidden': 1, 'clothing': 1, 'It': 1, 'leads': 1, 'being': 1, 'happy': 1, 'deciding': 1, 'keep': 1}	{'PROPN': 3, 'VERB': 41, 'ADP': 25, 'DET': 34, 'NOUN': 43, 'PART': 5, 'PRON': 32, 'PUNCT': 14, 'ADJ': 5, 'SCONJ': 4, 'ADV': 21, 'CCONJ': 11, 'AUX': 2}

As he passed the street, a man threw stones out of his window which nearly hit Chaplin. Uninterested, Charly kept smoking his cigarette and kept walking. Suddenly, he was hit by a big stone from another unknown person. He stoped and pulled out a small box out of his inner jacket pocket. He opened the box, took out a new cigarette, put off his gloves, and touched his shoe sole in order to set fire to his cigarette. Not knowing where to put his gloves, he threw them in the can next to him. As the looked to the other side, he saw a baby left alone next to the ashes on the street. He went to the baby but then looked up to the windows, thinking whether someone threw the baby out or was missing it. Then he lifted the baby up and wasn‘t sure where to go. As he saw a woman with a trolley walking behind him, he followed her. She entered into the building while Charly laid the baby in her trolley. She came out and saw a second baby in her trolley, then saw Chaplin, shoutet at him and told him to take the baby. Charly went back to the spot where he found the baby and wanted to lay it there. But then a policeman saw his act and Charly took the baby again. He walked on and saw another old man and pretended that he had to tie his shoe but then ran away. The old man followed him and then saw the trolley and put the baby in the woman‘s trolley. The woman came out of yet another shop and saw Charly walking in front of her. She hit him with her umberella and forced him to take the baby again as the policeman saw the happening. Chaplin took the baby and went away. He sat down on the street and saw a gulli, opened it and looked at the baby but then closed it again. Then he saw a letter saying:“Please love and care for this orphan child“.  He put the letter in his pocket, smiled at the baby and left the scene.		{'In': 1, 'the': 31, 'beginning': 1, 'of': 6, 'scene': 2, ',': 15, 'Chaplin': 4, 'walked': 2, 'down': 2, 'a': 12, 'street': 4, 'full': 1, ' ': 2, 'ash': 1, 'and': 20, 'wreck': 1, '.': 23, 'As': 3, 'he': 10, 'passed': 1, 'man': 3, 'threw': 3, 'stones': 1, 'out': 7, 'his': 10, 'window': 1, 'which': 1, 'nearly': 1, 'hit': 3, 'Uninterested': 1, 'Charly': 5, 'kept': 2, 'smoking': 1, 'cigarette': 3, 'walking': 3, 'Suddenly': 1, 'was': 2, 'by': 1, 'big': 1, 'stone': 1, 'from': 1, 'another': 3, 'unknown': 1, 'person': 1, 'He': 6, 'stoped': 1, 'pulled': 1, 'small': 1, 'box': 2, 'inner': 1, 'jacket': 1, 'pocket': 2, 'opened': 2, 'took': 3, 'new': 1, 'put': 4, 'off': 1, 'gloves': 2, 'touched': 1, 'shoe': 2, 'sole': 1, 'in': 7, 'order': 1, 'to': 14, 'set': 1, 'fire': 1, 'Not': 1, 'knowing': 1, 'where': 3, 'them': 1, 'can': 1, 'next': 2, 'him': 7, 'looked': 3, 'other': 1, 'side': 1, 'saw': 11, 'baby': 14, 'left': 2, 'alone': 1, 'ashes': 1, 'on': 3, 'went': 3, 'but': 3, 'then': 6, 'up': 2, 'windows': 1, 'thinking': 1, 'whether': 1, 'someone': 1, 'or': 1, 'missing': 1, 'it': 4, 'Then': 2, 'lifted': 1, 'wasn‘t': 1, 'sure': 1, 'go': 1, 'woman': 2, 'with': 2, 'trolley': 5, 'behind': 1, 'followed': 2, 'her': 5, 'She': 3, 'entered': 1, 'into': 1, 'building': 1, 'while': 1, 'laid': 1, 'came': 2, 'second': 1, 'shoutet': 1, 'at': 3, 'told': 1, 'take': 2, 'back': 1, 'spot': 1, 'found': 1, 'wanted': 1, 'lay': 1, 'there': 1, 'But': 1, 'policeman': 2, 'act': 1, 'again': 3, 'old': 2, 'pretended': 1, 'that': 1, 'had': 1, 'tie': 1, 'ran': 1, 'away': 2, 'The': 2, 'woman‘s': 1, 'yet': 1, 'shop': 1, 'front': 1, 'umberella': 1, 'forced': 1, 'as': 1, 'happening': 1, 'sat': 1, 'gulli': 1, 'closed': 1, 'letter': 2, 'saying:“Please': 1, 'love': 1, 'care': 1, 'for': 1, 'this': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'child': 1, '“': 1, 'smiled': 1}	{'ADP': 46, 'DET': 48, 'NOUN': 73, 'PUNCT': 39, 'PROPN': 10, 'VERB': 74, 'ADJ': 12, 'SPACE': 2, 'CCONJ': 25, 'SCONJ': 10, 'PRON': 49, 'ADV': 20, 'AUX': 3, 'PART': 8}

Stones fall down from the rooftops and almost hit Chapling. While he grumbles about the falling rubble he sees a baby covered in blankets lying in a dirty corner. Chaplin recognizes a woman carrying a pram and assumes that the baby is hers. When Chaplin tries to put the baby back into the pram, the woman gets angry and curses at Chaplin. Cunfused, Chaplin puts the baby back into the corner, where a police officer watches him and gets Chaplin in trouble. While running away from the police officer, Chaplin places the baby in the arms of an old man, who gets confused and looks for the place where the baby might come from. The old man finds the woman with the pram, places the baby inside the pram and disappears.At this moment Chaplin arrives at the place where the woman with the pram stands. The woman blames Chaplin again, who takes the baby out of the Pram and runs away. He sits down at the kerb and thinks about what to do with the child. While he weights up whether to put the baby into the sewers, he finds a letter, whch says ""Please love and care for this orphaned child"". Smilingly, Chaplin puts the letter inside the pocket of his coat and leaves with the baby in his arms."

With the baby in his arm he walked away and came across a men. Next he pretended to tie his shoe laces so that the other men was forced to carry the baby for him. As soon as the other men picked the baby up, the men flew. But the men, who was now stuck with the baby, talked to the police men about the situation so that the men from the beginning came back and took the child back. With the kid in his arm he went back to the corner from the beginning. He sat down and found a piece of paper in the blanket that the baby was wrapped in.

While he smokes he finds a little baby. The baby is lying on the floor in the middle of the alleyway and is crying. That is the reason why Chaplin indicates the poor little baby. He picks the baby up and Looks around to find the Person who has lost the baby. Finally he finds a baby stroller standing in the front of a store and lais the baby in it. A furious woman Comes out of the store. Chaplin sais ""i am sorry you dropped something"". They are arguing and he needs to take the baby again because in the stroller there is already sitting a kid. This kid belongs to the woman. So, Chaplin don't know what to do with the baby. He goes back to the place where he found the baby and wants to put it back. At this time, the Police officer Comes by and sees Chaplin putting the baby on the Floor in the alleyway. So Chaplin picks up the baby and leaves the alleyway as fast as he can. Right around the Corner he sees an old man walking down the street. Chaplin pretends to tie up his shoes, while the man is holding the baby. A few seconds later Chaplin rans away. The old man takes the baby and walks away. As soon as he finds a baby stroller in front of a store he puts the baby in it and leaves the kid. Chaplin heads the same way. He crosses the stroller at the same time as the woman Comes out of the store. What a surprise, it is the same woman as in the scene earlier. She gives the baby back to Chaplin. He sits down the sidewalk to get some rest. He finds a note under the jacket of the baby. The note sais please love and care of this child. This warms up his heart. He put the note in his pocket and takes the baby with him. with a bis smile on his face."

Suddenly someone throughs out garbage from an open window, he manages to step aside. A few steps later he is not that lucky. In anger Chaplin recognizes that is cigarette was blown out and he takes out a new one with very explicit movements which is characteristic for Charlie Chaplins slapstick scenes. Afterwards he looks around and discovers a crying baby laying between a wall and some trashcans. Meanwhile a young mother walks past in the background with a pushchair and a baby. Chaplin sees her and as she shortly walks into a house he places the baby next to the child of the unknown women. Unfortunately she walks out again just in this very moment and does not seem amused at all. So he then tries something else and carries the baby back to the place where he found it. Just as he turns around to walk away a man in uniform stands a few steps behind him giving him a strict look that makes Chaplin taking the child back on immediately. Another set appears, Chaplin walks down a street to an old man and hands him the baby, pretending to fix his shoe laces so he can run away. The old man chases him but is not able to move fast enough. He walks past the pushchair of the lady from the first scene and tries the same trick as Chaplin did before. He gets along with it but as soon as the mother walks out a magazine door and sees the second child she starts to search the street. Chaplin passes by, thinking himself safe as the mother runs after him and slaps him with her umbrella. He has to take the baby back and in the last scene he sits down on the street with the little child in his arm wondering what to do with it. Looking at its face and little clothing he discovers a piece of paper, unfolds it and after reading he know nows that this is an orphan child someone hoped that good people would care about. He smiles and then walks off into the distance, carrying his new child.		{'In': 2, 'the': 22, 'short': 1, 'clip': 1, 'Charlie': 2, 'Chaplin': 7, 'walks': 8, 'down': 3, 'a': 14, 'small': 1, 'street': 4, '.': 19, 'He': 5, 'is': 6, 'smoking': 1, 'Suddenly': 1, 'someone': 2, 'throughs': 1, 'out': 5, 'garbage': 1, 'from': 2, 'an': 3, 'open': 1, 'window': 1, ',': 6, 'he': 12, 'manages': 1, 'to': 10, 'step': 1, 'aside': 1, 'A': 1, 'few': 2, 'steps': 2, 'later': 1, 'not': 3, 'that': 5, 'lucky': 1, 'anger': 1, 'recognizes': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'was': 1, 'blown': 1, 'and': 15, 'takes': 1, 'new': 2, 'one': 1, 'with': 6, 'very': 2, 'explicit': 1, 'movements': 1, 'which': 1, 'characteristic': 1, 'for': 1, 'Chaplins': 1, 'slapstick': 1, 'scenes': 1, 'Afterwards': 1, 'looks': 1, 'around': 2, 'discovers': 2, 'crying': 1, 'baby': 6, 'laying': 1, 'between': 1, 'wall': 1, 'some': 1, 'trashcans': 1, 'Meanwhile': 1, 'young': 1, 'mother': 3, 'past': 2, 'in': 5, 'background': 1, 'pushchair': 2, 'sees': 2, 'her': 2, 'as': 6, 'she': 3, 'shortly': 1, 'into': 2, 'house': 1, 'places': 1, 'next': 1, 'child': 6, 'of': 3, 'unknown': 1, 'women': 1, 'Unfortunately': 1, 'again': 1, 'just': 1, 'this': 2, 'moment': 1, 'does': 1, 'seem': 1, 'amused': 1, 'at': 2, 'all': 1, 'So': 1, 'then': 2, 'tries': 2, 'something': 1, 'else': 1, 'carries': 1, 'back': 3, 'place': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'it': 4, 'Just': 1, 'turns': 1, 'walk': 1, 'away': 2, 'man': 3, 'uniform': 1, 'stands': 1, 'behind': 1, 'him': 6, 'giving': 1, 'strict': 1, 'look': 1, 'makes': 1, 'taking': 1, 'on': 2, 'immediately': 1, 'Another': 1, 'set': 1, 'appears': 1, 'old': 2, 'hands': 1, 'pretending': 1, 'fix': 1, 'his': 3, 'shoe': 1, 'laces': 1, 'so': 1, 'can': 1, 'run': 1, 'The': 1, 'chases': 1, 'but': 2, 'able': 1, 'move': 1, 'fast': 1, 'enough': 1, 'lady': 1, 'first': 1, 'scene': 2, 'same': 1, 'trick': 1, 'did': 1, 'before': 1, 'gets': 1, 'along': 1, 'soon': 1, 'magazine': 1, 'door': 1, 'second': 1, 'starts': 1, 'search': 1, 'passes': 1, 'by': 1, 'thinking': 1, 'himself': 1, 'safe': 1, 'runs': 1, 'after': 2, 'slaps': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'has': 1, 'take': 1, 'last': 1, 'sits': 1, 'little': 2, 'arm': 1, 'wondering': 1, 'what': 1, 'do': 1, 'Looking': 1, 'its': 1, 'face': 1, 'clothing': 1, 'piece': 1, 'paper': 1, 'unfolds': 1, 'reading': 1, 'know': 1, 'nows': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'hoped': 1, 'good': 1, 'people': 1, 'would': 1, 'care': 1, 'about': 1, 'smiles': 1, 'off': 1, 'distance': 1, 'carrying': 1}	{'ADP': 44, 'DET': 44, 'ADJ': 26, 'NOUN': 61, 'PROPN': 10, 'VERB': 64, 'PUNCT': 25, 'PRON': 45, 'AUX': 10, 'ADV': 33, 'PART': 10, 'CCONJ': 17, 'SCONJ': 9}

After he lights a cigarette, he finds a newborn next to a trashcan. While he tries to figure out where the child’s mother might be, a woman with a baby stroller enters the stage. Assuming she is the mother, he lays the newborn into the stroller, next to the woman’s child. As she is not the mother, she indignantly urges him to pick up his child and leaves the alleyway. While Mister Chaplin is laying down the newborn next to the trashcan again, a police officer enters the alleyway – Mister Chaplin is forced to take the child again. By a trick he hands over the child to a stranger, who is laying down the child in the baby stroller of the mother, who entered the alleyway earlier. After that Mister Chaplin walks across the stroller and, again, gets forced to pick the child up by the woman and the patrolling police officer. Not knowing what to do next, he sits down on the sidewalk and finds a letter, hidden in the child’s blanket, saying he should take care of the orphan. He seems to compassionate the child, takes it in his arms, gets up and leaves the stage.		{'Mister': 4, 'Chaplin': 4, 'enters': 3, 'a': 10, 'small': 1, 'alleyway': 4, '.': 10, 'After': 2, 'he': 7, 'lights': 1, 'cigarette': 1, ',': 15, 'finds': 2, 'newborn': 3, 'next': 4, 'to': 10, 'trashcan': 2, 'While': 2, 'tries': 1, 'figure': 1, 'out': 1, 'where': 1, 'the': 26, 'child': 9, '’s': 3, 'mother': 4, 'might': 1, 'be': 1, 'woman': 3, 'with': 1, 'baby': 2, 'stroller': 4, 'stage': 2, 'Assuming': 1, 'she': 3, 'is': 5, 'lays': 1, 'into': 1, 'As': 1, 'not': 1, 'indignantly': 1, 'urges': 1, 'him': 1, 'pick': 2, 'up': 3, 'his': 2, 'and': 5, 'leaves': 2, 'laying': 2, 'down': 3, 'again': 3, 'police': 2, 'officer': 2, '–': 1, 'forced': 2, 'take': 2, 'By': 1, 'trick': 1, 'hands': 1, 'over': 1, 'stranger': 1, 'who': 2, 'in': 3, 'of': 2, 'entered': 1, 'earlier': 1, 'that': 1, 'walks': 1, 'across': 1, 'gets': 2, 'by': 1, 'patrolling': 1, 'Not': 1, 'knowing': 1, 'what': 1, 'do': 1, 'sits': 1, 'on': 1, 'sidewalk': 1, 'letter': 1, 'hidden': 1, 'blanket': 1, 'saying': 1, 'should': 1, 'care': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'He': 1, 'seems': 1, 'compassionate': 1, 'takes': 1, 'it': 1, 'arms': 1}	{'PROPN': 8, 'VERB': 33, 'DET': 36, 'ADJ': 2, 'NOUN': 46, 'PUNCT': 26, 'SCONJ': 5, 'PRON': 19, 'ADV': 9, 'ADP': 24, 'PART': 11, 'AUX': 9, 'CCONJ': 5}

Then she is in rage and tells him that this is not her baby. Charlie goes back to the place where he found the baby and lays it down, right back behind the trashcan. A police officer appears and seems to think that Charlie tries to abandon the baby. To avoid serious trouble, Charlie takes the baby with him down the street. He asks an old man with a walking stick to hold the baby for a moment and runs way. The old man can't find Charlie, but spots a buggy (the same of the woman at the beginning of the story) and lays the baby in the buggy and runs away. Charlie walks by a few seconds later and the woman comes out of a store, finding the foreign baby in her buggy again. She sees Charlie and beats him with her umbrella. Again the police officer walks by, to avoid serious trouble again, Charlie takes the baby and sits down the street on the sidewalk.

Since his attempts of leaving the baby in another woman's stroller remain unsuccessful and the idea of giving the baby to strangers turns out the same way, he gets used to keeping the baby. As he finds a note in the baby's clothes which bid the person finding the child to love it and care for it, it seems like Chaplin decides to do so.

face looks a bit uh yeah annoyed or he is yeah he’s a bit aggressive about this experience and then he lits or he tries to lit a cigarette or yeah a cigarette and uh suddenly he see or he saw uh a baby lying on the street in a corner and uh he looks around and no one is is there and he he takes the baby and uh is still searching for his or her mother probably and I as a viewer I saw a woman walking behind Charlie Chaplin with another baby in a in a / not a wheel chair but uh yeah and she enters uh a shop or a house and Charlie Chaplin turns around and he takes the the probably orphan baby orphan child and puts it to the other baby from the woman and he se= seems to look or he looks really happy about it because he found his or her mother but the woman comes out of the shop and she’s really annoyed and aggressive that Charlie Chaplin uh gave her uh yeah unknown child and he returns or he uh she gives the child back to Charlie Chaplin and he’s confused and uh yeah walks back to the place to the corner where he found the child and he uh wants to hhh uh put it back hhh on the ground but uh a police officer comes across and uh Charlie Chaplin uh stops his action and he yeah tries to walk away and uh hhh doesn’t co= get in a conflict with the police officer after that another person uh enters the story for me was like an old man who walked really slow and Charlie Chaplin like uh / yeah he tries to maybe close his shoes or something like that and / for me it looked like he asked the man could you hold the baby for a second or something but there was no language and the old man takes the baby and Charlie Chaplin runs away hhh and the old man walks really fast so he couldn’t reach Charlie Chaplin or can keep return the baby to him hhh so he walks through the streets of this maybe small city or yeah and he comes across the first baby from the woman in uh in the wagon uh and the old man puts the baby in the wagon because he thinks this baby belongs to the other baby maybe they are siblings or something like that and uh / a minute or a second later Charlie Chaplin or a lot of other people walk across these two babies uh and Charlie Chaplin walks uh by and the woman comes out of the house again or yeah returns to h=her chil her child and the other child and then she h=hits uh hit Charlie Chaplin because she was  so frustrated about Charlie Chaplin because he out of her perspective he tried to return the baby to her twice but she knows it’s not her baby and she thinks it’s his probably so Charlie Chaplin ends with the baby in his arms and he walks like down the streets and uh he sat down and then he found or yeah he looked maybe for but he found a little sheet of paper where I couldn’t read properly but uh there was written like uh please love ‘n’ care for an orphan orphan child so uh in the end he keeps the baby and the last scene is that he walks away with the baby in his arm.		{'Hello': 1, 'uh': 33, 'I': 7, 'watched': 1, 'the': 43, 'movie':

At the end of the street Charlie finds a baby laying on the ground, in the corner. He picks the baby up and turns around. In that moment, he sees a woman with stroller walk by. Charlie immediately walks up to the stroller, thinking it is the woman’s baby. So he puts the baby in it. When she sees the baby, she confronts Charlie with it and tells him to take the baby out since it is not hers. After he took the baby out, he walks back to the corner and wants to put it back. That is when a police officer walks by and notices him. So Charlie takes the baby and walks away. Around the corner he sees an old man walking by. Who he then outwits into holding the child. While the old man is holding the baby, Charlie quickly runs off and hides. So the old man walks down the street, with the baby in his hands, he sees the woman with the stroller and puts the baby in it. After that he runs away. Later, Charlie comes out of his hiding place and walks down this street in the exact moment that the woman notices the foreign child in her stroller. She sees Charlie and runs after him, hits him with her umbrella and tells him to take the baby. He again ist forced to do so, since the police officer was walking by in the same moment. So he sits down at the roadside, contemplating to put the baby in the drain. He does not do it. While he is holding the baby, he suddenly cuts hisself on so piece of paper which was hidden in the baby’s blanket. He takes it out and reads what is written on it. The paper reads: “ Please love and care for this orphan child. “  <br/> Suddenly Charlie gets very emotional and decides to take care of this orphan child.		{'In': 2, 'the': 37, 'beginning': 1, 'of': 6, 'Chaplin': 2, 'video': 1, ',': 15, 'Charlie': 9, 'walks': 7, 'down': 4, 'a': 4, 'street': 4, 'while': 1, 'rubbish': 1, 'gets': 2, 'thrown': 1, 'out': 5, 'houses': 1, 'above': 1, 'him': 7, 'and': 14, 'hits': 2, '.': 24, 'At': 1, 'end': 1, 'finds': 1, 'baby': 15, 'laying': 1, 'on': 3, 'ground': 1, 'in': 9, 'corner': 3, 'He': 4, 'picks': 1, 'up': 2, 'turns': 1, 'around': 1, 'that': 3, 'moment': 3, 'he': 11, 'sees': 5, 'woman': 4, 'with': 5, 'stroller': 4, 'walk': 1, 'by': 4, 'immediately': 1, 'to': 8, 'thinking': 1, 'it': 9, 'is': 6, '’s': 2, 'So': 4, 'puts': 2, 'When': 1, 'she': 2, 'confronts': 1, 'tells': 2, 'take': 3, 'since': 2, 'not': 2, 'hers': 1, 'After': 2, 'took': 1, 'back': 2, 'wants': 1, 'put': 2, 'That': 1, 'when': 1, 'police': 2, 'officer': 2, 'notices': 2, 'takes': 2, 'away': 2, 'Around': 1, 'an': 1, 'old': 3, 'man': 3, 'walking': 2, 'Who': 1, 'then': 1, 'outwits': 1, 'into': 1, 'holding': 3, 'child': 4, 'While': 2, 'quickly': 1, 'runs': 3, 'off': 1, 'hides': 1, 'his': 2, 'hands': 1, 'Later': 1, 'comes': 1, 'hiding': 1, 'place': 1, 'this': 3, 'exact': 1, 'foreign': 1, 'her': 2, 'She': 1, 'after': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'again': 1, 'ist': 1, 'forced': 1, 'do': 2, 'so': 2, 'was': 2, 'same': 1, 'sits': 1, 'at': 1, 'roadside': 1, 'contemplating': 1, 'drain': 1, 'does': 1, 'suddenly': 1, 'cuts': 1, 'hisself': 1, 'piece': 1, 'paper': 2, 'which': 1, 'hidden': 1, 'blanket': 1, 'reads': 2, 'what': 1, 'written': 1, 'The': 1, ':': 1, '“': 2, 'Please': 1, 'love': 1, 'care': 2, 'for': 1, 'orphan': 2, ' ': 1, '<': 1, 'br/': 1, '>': 1, 'Suddenly': 1, 'very': 1, 'emotional': 1, 'decides': 1}	{'ADP': 51, 'DET': 47, 'NOUN': 64, 'PROPN': 12, 'PUNCT': 42, 'VERB': 62, 'SCONJ': 9, 'AUX': 11, 'PRON': 44, 'CCONJ': 14, 'ADV': 18, 'PART': 10, 'ADJ': 8, 'INTJ': 1, 'SPACE': 1, 'X': 2}

During his walk he is hit by items which are thrown out of windows above him. He is upset and lits a cigeratte. He then finds and picks up a crying baby in the corner and wonders if it was thrown out as well. When he sees a mother with a buggy he considers the baby to be hers and lays it in her buggy while she leaves for a moment. It turns out that it is not her baby and she angrily confronts him when she returns. Chaplin takes the baby and wants to put it back in the corner where he found it but a police officer interrupts him. Chaplin has no other choice than taking the baby with him. When he passes a stranger he gives him the baby and runs away. The stranger secretly puts the baby in the above-mentioned mother’s buggy and leaves. The mother returns and only a moment later Chaplin passes by. The mother accuses him for putting the baby in her buggy and beats him out of anger. When the police officer arrives she reports what happened and Chaplin takes the baby with him again. He sits down on a sidewalk and then finds a small piece of paper in the baby‘s blanket. In the anonymous letter someone asks to take care of the baby. Chaplin understands and walks away happily with the baby in his arms.		{'The': 4, 'black': 1, '-': 2, 'white': 1, 'silent': 1, 'movie': 1, 'begins': 1, 'with': 5, 'a': 12, 'man': 1, '(': 1, 'Chaplin': 6, ')': 1, 'going': 1, 'for': 3, 'walk': 2, '.': 16, 'During': 1, 'his': 2, 'he': 6, 'is': 3, 'hit': 1, 'by': 2, 'items': 1, 'which': 1, 'are': 1, 'thrown': 2, 'out': 4, 'of': 4, 'windows': 1, 'above': 2, 'him': 8, 'He': 3, 'upset': 1, 'and': 13, 'lits': 1, 'cigeratte': 1, 'then': 2, 'finds': 2, 'picks': 1, 'up': 1, 'crying': 1, 'baby': 11, 'in': 7, 'the': 15, 'corner': 2, 'wonders': 1, 'if': 1, 'it': 5, 'was': 1, 'as': 1, 'well': 1, 'When': 3, 'sees': 1, 'mother': 4, 'buggy': 4, 'considers': 1, 'to': 3, 'be': 1, 'hers': 1, 'lays': 1, 'her': 3, 'while': 1, 'she': 4, 'leaves': 2, 'moment': 2, 'It': 1, 'turns': 1, 'that': 1, 'not': 1, 'angrily': 1, 'confronts': 1, 'when': 1, 'returns': 2, 'takes': 2, 'wants': 1, 'put': 1, 'back': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'but': 1, 'police': 2, 'officer': 2, 'interrupts': 1, 'has': 1, 'no': 1, 'other': 1, 'choice': 1, 'than': 1, 'taking': 1, 'passes': 2, 'stranger': 2, 'gives': 1, 'runs': 1, 'away': 2, 'secretly': 1, 'puts': 1, 'mentioned': 1, '’s': 1, 'only': 1, 'later': 1, 'accuses': 1, 'putting': 1, 'beats': 1, 'anger': 1, 'arrives': 1, 'reports': 1, 'what': 1, 'happened': 1, 'again': 1, 'sits': 1, 'down': 1, 'on': 1, 'sidewalk': 1, 'small': 1, 'piece': 1, 'paper': 1, 'baby‘s': 1, 'blanket': 1, 'In': 1, 'anonymous': 1, 'letter': 1, 'someone': 1, 'asks': 1, 'take': 1, 'care': 1, 'understands': 1, 'walks': 1, 'happily': 1, 'arms': 1}	{'DET': 32, 'ADJ': 9, 'PUNCT': 20, 'NOUN': 46, 'VERB': 43, 'ADP': 32, 'PROPN': 6, 'PRON': 36, 'AUX': 6, 'CCONJ': 14, 'ADV': 14, 'SCONJ': 8, 'PART': 5}

While walking a man in an apartment is throwing out some building rubble, Chaplin is not getting hit by it but is cleaning his suit from the dusk. As he keeps walking there's another man who is throwing  rubbish out of the window. This time Chaplin get hit and is getting angry. To recover of the stress he's putting his cigarrettes out of a box in his pocket. Before starting to smoke he's pulling off his gloves. It seems like he lights the match on his shoe. While smoking he's looking around and recognizes a baby who is laying next to the rubbish bins. Chaplin starts looking around to find someone who might be the one responsible for the child, but can't find anyone. While he's grabbing the baby a woman with a stroller, with already one baby sitting in in, passes by. As soon as the woman stopped to go into the building Chaplin puts the baby he found in the woman's stroller. In this moment the woman is coming out of the door and starts shouting at him to make cleare, that it's not her child,. That's why Charles takes the child back into his arms again and is walking away. He wants to put the baby pack to the place where he found it but a police officer passed by at this moment, so Charles decided to walk away with the baby. On his way he comes across a older man with a walking stick, Charles is acting like tying his shoes to be able to put the baby into the arms of the old man. After a few seconds he starts running away and leaves the man alone with the baby. The old man starts running after him, but can't find Charles who is hiding behind a door. His way leads the man to the stroller of the woman earlier and like Chaplin did, he puts the baby in the stroller and runs away. As soon as Charles comes out of his hiding place he's running into the arms of the police officer again. Meanwhile the women comes out of the building and finds the baby again in her stroller. Charles walks by the stroller again and the woman recognize him and is starting to hit him with her umbrella whilst pulling him back to the stroller with the two babys. While arguing with the women the police officer passes by who became aware of the situation, the fight led to nothing and Charles grabs the baby again and walks away. He's sitting down on a kerb with the babys in his arms. Next to him is a discharge shaft and for a short moment he's thinking about putting the baby in there - but he decides otherwise. He's taking a closer look at the baby and finds a note in the cover which is saying ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". That's why he decides to take care of the lonely child and takes it with him."

He picks it up, sees a lady with a pram walking past and points out to her that she lost something and lays the child in the pram. The lady is not amused and Charles Chaplin brings the baby back to where he found it but a policeman is watching him – so he keeps the child. Under the pretext of having to close his shoes, he gives the baby to a stranger and runs away. The stranger however lays the baby again in the woman’s pram who is in a shop in the meantime and the stranger leaves. Charles Chaplin walks past the pram in the moment when the woman sees the baby in her pram. In this moment the policeman arrives and after a short discussion Charles Chaplin leaves – together with the child. He sits down on a pavement. While considering what to do now, he finds a letter with the beg to care for the baby. Charles Chaplin smiles and walks away carrying the child in his arms.		{'In': 2, 'the': 22, 'beginning': 1, 'of': 2, 'sequence': 1, 'Charles': 5, 'Chaplin': 5, 'walks': 3, 'along': 1, 'a': 11, 'street': 1, ',': 4, 'smoking': 1, 'cigar': 1, 'and': 8, ' ': 1, 'suddenly': 1, 'finds': 2, 'little': 1, 'child': 5, 'laying': 1, 'on': 2, 'ground': 1, '.': 10, 'He': 2, 'picks': 1, 'it': 2, 'up': 1, 'sees': 2, 'lady': 2, 'with': 3, 'pram': 5, 'walking': 1, 'past': 2, 'points': 1, 'out': 1, 'to': 6, 'her': 2, 'that': 1, 'she': 1, 'lost': 1, 'something': 1, 'lays': 2, 'in': 7, 'The': 2, 'is': 3, 'not': 1, 'amused': 1, 'brings': 1, 'baby': 5, 'back': 1, 'where': 1, 'he': 4, 'found': 1, 'but': 1, 'policeman': 2, 'watching': 1, 'him': 1, '–': 2, 'so': 1, 'keeps': 1, 'Under': 1, 'pretext': 1, 'having': 1, 'close': 1, 'his': 2, 'shoes': 1, 'gives': 1, 'stranger': 3, 'runs': 1, 'away': 2, 'however': 1, 'again': 1, 'woman': 2, '’s': 1, 'who': 1, 'shop': 1, 'meantime': 1, 'leaves': 2, 'moment': 2, 'when': 1, 'this': 1, 'arrives': 1, 'after': 1, 'short': 1, 'discussion': 1, 'together': 1, 'sits': 1, 'down': 1, 'pavement': 1, 'While': 1, 'considering': 1, 'what': 1, 'do': 1, 'now': 1, 'letter': 1, 'beg': 1, 'care': 1, 'for': 1, 'smiles': 1, 'carrying': 1, 'arms': 1}	{'ADP': 27, 'DET': 36, 'NOUN': 42, 'PROPN': 10, 'VERB': 32, 'PUNCT': 16, 'CCONJ': 9, 'SPACE': 1, 'ADV': 8, 'ADJ': 2, 'PRON': 17, 'SCONJ': 5, 'AUX': 3, 'PART': 5}

As he pulls out a cigarette to light up, he looks in the corner of the alley and finds a baby laying on the ground. When he sees a women with a stroller walking by, he immediately thinks it's hers and wants to give it back. The women was gone when he puts the baby inside the stroller. As soon as she saw the Baby in the stroller and Charlie standing next to it, they start to argue. After that, Charlie takes the baby and walks away with the intention to put it back in the corner of the alley. In the process of doing so, a police officer showed up behind Charlie. When Charlie noticed the officer he takes the baby again and goes away. As he walks down a street with the baby on his arms, he notices an old man. He outwits the old man by asking him to hold the baby while he ties his shoes. As soon as the old man was holding the baby, he runs away and hides in the alley, where he found the baby before. The old man walks to a road where he sees the stroller from the same women Charlie had argued with in the beginning. He puts the baby inside the stroller and runs away. Meanwhile, Charlie gets caught coming out of his hiding spot by the Police officer. Charlie runs away again, directly onto the street where the women was with the stroller. As he passes them, the woman recognises Charlie again and runs after him. She hits him with her umbrella and tells him to take the child back as the police officer walks up. Charlie is forced to take the baby back and goes away. As he sits down at the roadside, he considers to put the baby in the drain but doesn't do it. While he holds the baby, he cuts his finger on something and pulls out a piece of paper with the caption ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". He then gets emotional and takes the baby with him as he walks away."

When he sees a men with a walking stick he decides to trick him. He pretends like he has to tie his shoes and therefore asks the men to hold the child. When the man agrees, he runs away.

By coincidence, the man from the beginning walks along exactly when the woman finds the strange baby in her pram again. She catches the men and hits him with an umbrella. When the police officer arrives, he believes that the baby belongs to the men because he saw him with it before. So he takes it with him and sits down on a pavement.

One man dumps it right on  the main characters’ head. Right next to a lot of garbage on the ground and a dumpster the main character finds a little baby, covered by a blanket, right in the ground. First he does not know what to do with it, so he leaves the baby with a woman walking another baby in a cart. But she tells him to take his baby back. When he tries to put it back to where he had found it a police officer comes and tells him to keep the baby.

A woman who lives in a house on the street throws rubbish out of the window. The rubbish falls on Charlie, but he continues walking. After he is hit by rubbish for the second time, he takes out a cigar and starts to smoke it. Then he sees a baby, wrapped up in a blanket, laying on the ground. He looks around but no one is there. He picks up the baby and as he turns around he sees a woman with a stroler and a baby in it. Charlie goes to the stroler and places the baby in it. The mother of the other baby is not pleased with Charlies action and argues. So he takes the baby out of the stroler and goes back to where he found it. There he puts the baby down on the street. As he starts to walk away a police officer occurs. Charlie turns around takes the baby and runs away. He meets an old man who is walking along the street and hands the baby over to him before the old man could agree. Then he hides from the old man. Stuck with the baby the old man walks past a stroler and puts the baby into it. The stroler belongs to the woman that Charlie wanted to give the baby to earlier. Charlie passes the stroler, in the same moment in which the woman sees the other child next to hers. She runs after Charlie, hitting him with an umbrella. She forces him to take back the baby. Charlie takes the baby and sits down on the sidewalk. He finds a note in the blankets, saying that someone should love this orphaned child. In the last sequence of the video, he smiles at the baby, and walks away.		{'In': 2, 'the': 35, 'black': 1, 'and': 12, 'white': 1, 'video': 2, ',': 10, 'you': 1, 'can': 1, 'see': 1, 'a': 11, 'man': 5, '(': 1, 'Charlie': 8, 'Chaplin': 1, ')': 1, 'walking': 3, 'down': 3, 'street': 4, '.': 23, 'A': 1, 'woman': 4, 'who': 2, 'lives': 1, 'in': 7, 'house': 1, 'on': 5, 'throws': 1, 'rubbish': 3, 'out': 3, 'of': 4, 'window': 1, 'The': 3, 'falls': 1, 'but': 2, 'he': 12, 'continues': 1, 'After': 1, 'is': 4, 'hit': 1, 'by': 1, 'for': 1, 'second': 1, 'time': 1, 'takes': 4, 'cigar': 1, 'starts': 2, 'to': 10, 'smoke': 1, 'it': 5, 'Then': 2, 'sees': 3, 'baby': 15, 'wrapped': 1, 'up': 2, 'blanket': 1, 'laying': 1, 'ground': 1, 'He': 4, 'looks': 1, 'around': 3, 'no': 1, 'one': 1, 'there': 1, 'picks': 1, 'as': 1, 'turns': 2, 'with': 4, 'stroler': 6, 'goes': 2, 'places': 1, 'mother': 1, 'other': 2, 'not': 1, 'pleased': 1, 'Charlies': 1, 'action': 1, 'argues': 1, 'So': 1, 'back': 2, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'There': 1, 'puts': 2, 'As': 1, 'walk': 1, 'away': 3, 'police': 1, 'officer': 1, 'occurs': 1, 'runs': 2, 'meets': 1, 'an': 2, 'old': 4, 'along': 1, 'hands': 1, 'over': 1, 'him': 3, 'before': 1, 'could': 1, 'agree': 1, 'hides': 1, 'from': 1, 'Stuck': 1, 'walks': 2, 'past': 1, 'into': 1, 'belongs': 1, 'that': 2, 'wanted': 1, 'give': 1, 'earlier': 1, 'passes': 1, 'same': 1, 'moment': 1, 'which': 1, 'child': 2, 'next': 1, 'hers': 1, 'She': 2, 'after': 1, 'hitting': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'forces': 1, 'take': 1, 'sits': 1, 'sidewalk': 1, 'finds': 1, 'note': 1, 'blankets': 1, 'saying': 1, 'someone': 1, 'should': 1, 'love': 1, 'this': 1, 'orphaned': 1, 'last': 1, 'sequence': 1, 'smiles': 1, 'at': 1}	{'ADP': 46, 'DET': 54, 'ADJ': 13, 'CCONJ': 14, 'NOUN': 57, 'PUNCT': 35, 'PRON': 33, 'AUX': 7, 'VERB': 56, 'PROPN': 10, 'SCONJ': 6, 'PART': 5, 'ADV': 14}

When he passes the houses he is always hit by objects that somebody throws out of the window. After a while he reaches a place of dustbins where there is no risk of falling items anymore. When he calmly smokes a cigarette he notices a bundle of clothes behind one of the containers. Charlie Chaplin soon finds out that there is a baby inside the bundle. At first, he assumes the baby fell out of a window, then he sees a mother with a child in a pushchair and thinks that this woman could have dropped the other baby. However, he tries to get the woman's attention in vain. That's why Charlie Chaplin simply puts the baby into the lady's pushchair. When the woman finds out that there is another baby in her child's pushchair she becomes very angry and insistes Charlie Chaplin to fetch back the baby. When Charlie Chaplin decides to put the baby back where he had found it he is caught by a policeman. In his next attempt to get rid of the baby Charlie Chaplin tries to give the little child to a man, who carries a walking stick. <br/> The man does not want to be responsible for the baby and puts it again into the woman's pushchair. When the lady discovers that the strange baby is back in her child's pushchair she is very furious, chases Charlie Chaplin, hits him with her umbrella and forces him to fetch back the baby. Eventually, Charlie Chaplin feels so overwhelmed with his duty to care for the child that he considers to throw it into gully. When he discovers a note into the baby's bundle that begs the finder to lovingly care for this orphan Charlie Chaplin changes his opinion and decides to look after the child."

After that, he tries to place the baby at the exact same place where he found it but a policeman sees him and Charlie took the baby and flees. Next, he gave it with a trick to an elderly man. This seems to work but the elderly man also sees the woman with the buggy and places the baby in it.  As Charlie walks by the woman notices that and follows him to punish him with her umbrella. Again, Charlie takes the baby with him. Resigned he sits down on a curb. One moment he considers the possibility to leave the little baby in a drain but he quickly discards this option.

Since he doesn't know what to do with the child, he tries to get rid of the kid, first by putting it into a somebody else's pram, maybe assuming that the child belongs to this woman, who, however, chases them away angrily. When Charlie wants to put the child back to where he found it, a police officer watches him, thinking that Charlie wants to abandon the child. After that Charlie takes off, together with the kid. He meets a passer-by, slipping the child into the passer-by's hand, before taking off again. The man who's got the child now unknowingly puts it into the same pram as Charlie did before. When the woman realizes that the unknown child is back again in her pram, she immediately thinks of Charlie who passes the street at that very moment. After getting beaten up by that lady and while argueing the police officer walks over and Charlie sees himself forced to take the child with him one more time. Then, he sits down on the roadside. When he notices a drain right next to him, he considers to throw the kid into it for a second but he decides not to do it. Shortly after, he finds a note in the child's cloth, saying that this child is an orphan that needs to be taken care of and that needs to be loved.

While grabing and igniting a new cigar he finds a crying baby and tries to find the parents of the baby.

Just after the interaction with the lady Charles carries the baby back to the place where he had found  it getting caught by a police officer and nervously picking up the baby again. On his way Charles met an elderly man tricking him into holding the baby whilst he ties his shoes and secretly runs away.While Charles arrived in the mentioned alley hidding from the old man, the old man is seeking for him but finds the pram of the lady Charles met earlier. Then when Charles leaves his hidding spot he gets confronted by the same police officer again and just as he had escaped the policeman Charles walks by the pram while the lady notices that the baby from earlier is yet again in her pram. The lady then sees Charles putting him into dust and dragging him to the pram. Now the policeman had arrived at the pram and both the lady and the policeman are forcing Charles to take the baby. At the end while still searching for a solution for the baby problem Charles finds a note with the writing:""Please love and care for this orphan child"" After sitting on a wayside he stands up smilling the baby in his arms and walks away."

After a few moments, he notices a woman with a stroller. He assumes it must be her child and lays the baby down. However, it seems like this is not the case and Chaplin has to continue looking for the baby's parents. He figures that they were going to pick the baby up eventually and leaves it where he found it, only to pick it up shortly after. A policeman came around the corner and to ihm, it must've looked like Chaplin was going to leave his own child in the alley. Chaplin then tries to hand the baby to an old man by tricking him to hold it while tying his shoes. He flees from the man, who comes by the lady with the stroller again and, just as Chaplin did before, assumes it's her baby. When the woman comes back to her stroller and the unfamiliar baby, she spots Chaplin walking by and punches him. She then hands him the baby. Chaplin, holding the baby again, sits down on the sidewalk when he notices a piece of paper inbetween the baby's blanket. The child appears to be an orphan and Chaplin smiles, looks at the child and walks away holding it.

He is wearing a suit with a tie, a hat and gloves. He almost gets hit by something a woman throws out of her window. After litting a cigarette and getting rid of the gloves, a crying baby in a blanket on the floor draws his attention. He picks it up and looks around to see where it comes from. Then, he sees a woman strolling with a baby carriage with a baby. She leaves the carriage in front of a house and enters. Chaplin seizes this opportunity and puts his baby next to the other one in the carriage and says ""Pardon me, you dropped something"". The woman gets angry, then Chaplin takes the baby and leaves. He goes back to the place where he found it, wants to put it back on the floor but then, a man who appears to be an officer observes him which makes Chaplin take the baby with him. On his way, the crosses paths with an old man. He asks him to hold the baby while pretending to tie his shoes. Then, he runs away and hides. The old man follows him. He sees the same carriage with the baby Chaplin saw before. He puts in in and runs away. Meanwhile, Chaplin comes out of his hiding place and bumps into the officer. He then walks in the other direction, past the woman who comes out of the store and sees two babies in her carriage. She runs after Chaplin and hits him with an umbrella. Even though the video is voiceless, only with music put to it, you can tell that they are having a wild discussion.The officer sees that and listens to them without saying a word. Afterwards, Chaplin takes the baby and sits down on the pavement. After thinking about where to put the baby, he finds a piece of paper in its blanket that says ""Please love and take care for this orpan child"". Finally, the cuddles the baby, laughs at it and takes it with him."

He is wearing a suit, a hat and carrying a walking stick. A person is dumping his or her trash out of the window; it is hitting Chaplins' head. Chaplin recognizes it and white letters saying ""Awkward ass."" appear on a black background. Chaplin lights another cigar with a match he lit on fire by rubbing it on his shoe. He wants to continue walking down the street, when he suddenly sees a baby laying on the ground. He picks it up and puts it in the stroller of a women standing nearby, in which another child is sitting. ""Pardon me, you dropped something."" appears on the screen. The women makes it clear, that she is not happy about the second child in her stroller and Chaplin takes it back out. As he wants to lay it where he first found it, a police officer appears and Chaplin walks away fast, carrying the baby. An elderly man appears and Chaplin hands him the baby. The man tries to catch Chaplin, but then sees the same stroller Chaplin saw earlier, standing in front of a store. He puts the baby inside of it and walks away. As the woman is coming out of the store, Chaplin is walking past the store. The woman is hitting him with her umbrella, thinking that he must have put the baby back in her stroller and she informs the police officer about it. Chaplin walks away, carrying the baby and he sits down next to a drain cover, first contemplating wether he should put the baby into the drain, but he decides against it. He finds a note in the babys cover, which reads ""Please love and care for this orphan child."" He looks moved, then smiles at the baby, gets up and walks away with it."

After a short while he loses interesst in the baby and wants to get rid of it. At first he sees a woman with a perambulator with a child in it. When the woman looks away he tries to sneak his baby inside the perambulator but the woman catches him and chases him off. Then Charly tries to put the baby where he found it and walk away but there is a police officer that prevents him from doing that. After that Charly gives the baby to a man that is walking by. The man, while being in total confusion, runs after him. Charly hides behind a wall and the man sees the perambulator of the woman earlier. He droppes the baby there and walks away. After a short while the woman comes back and gets angry when she sees the strange baby in her perambulator again. <br/> In the meantime, Charly walks by, happy to got short of his little problem.

Chaplin starts swearing and smoking a cigarette. When he is looking around he finds a baby laying on the floor. He picks it up and tries to put it in in the stroller of a woman with another baby but the woman catches him and argues that it's not her child. Chaplin tries to put the baby back on the floor but a policeman arrives so Chaplin reconsiders his decision. Instead, he hands the baby to an old man and runs away. The old man puts the baby back into ther stroller of the woman Chaplin met before.The woman assumes that it was Chaplin and starts hitting him with an umbrella. The policeman arrives again  and the woman tells him the story. Chaplin has to take back the baby. He sits down with it and finds a letter in its clothes saying that the baby is an orphan. He feels sorry for the baby, interacts with it and finally leaves holding it closely to his breast.

He does not get hit by the trash from the first window but the second. He is annoyed by that and lights himself a cigarette. While smoking he found a baby and wanted to return it to a woman it did not belong to, which lead to a number of failed attempts to get rid of the baby. Turns out the baby was dropped off there with a note asking the finder to love and care for the baby. The last scene shows the main character with the baby sitting on a sidewalk.		{'The': 2, 'man': 1, 'in': 2, 'the': 10, 'video': 1, 'walks': 1, 'down': 1, 'an': 1, 'alley': 1, ',': 2, 'which': 2, 'people': 1, 'throw': 1, 'trash': 2, 'out': 2, 'of': 3, 'their': 1, 'windows': 1, '.': 6, 'He': 2, 'does': 1, 'not': 2, 'get': 2, 'hit': 1, 'by': 2, 'from': 1, 'first': 1, 'window': 1, 'but': 1, 'second': 1, 'is': 1, 'annoyed': 1, 'that': 1, 'and': 3, 'lights': 1, 'himself': 1, 'a': 6, 'cigarette': 1, 'While': 1, 'smoking': 1, 'he': 1, 'found': 1, 'baby': 5, 'wanted': 1, 'to': 6, 'return': 1, 'it': 2, 'woman': 1, 'did': 1, 'belong': 1, 'lead': 1, 'number': 1, 'failed': 1, 'attempts': 1, 'rid': 1, 'Turns': 1, 'was': 1, 'dropped': 1, 'off': 1, 'there': 1, 'with': 2, 'note': 1, 'asking': 1, 'finder': 1, 'love': 1, 'care': 1, 'for': 1, 'last': 1, 'scene': 1, 'shows': 1, 'main': 1, 'character': 1, 'sitting': 1, 'on': 1, 'sidewalk': 1}	{'DET': 19, 'NOUN': 22, 'ADP': 17, 'VERB': 20, 'ADV': 3, 'PUNCT': 8, 'PRON': 10, 'AUX': 6, 'PART': 5, 'ADJ': 4, 'CCONJ': 4, 'SCONJ': 1}

While doing so a woman throws her trash out of the window and almost hits him. A few seconds and meters later, an unknown persons who we do not see, does the same and hits him. Charlie is obviously angry and lights a cigarette. Just seconds after that he finds a baby, covered in sheets laying on the ground. He wonders if it was also just thrown out of the window or to whom it belongs. As a woman with a baby carriage passes by he chases her and wants to put it back in there because he believes that she lost one of hers. The woman gets furious as it turns out not to be her child and he walks away with the orphan. Charlie seems to be unable to cope with the situation and tries to get rid of the baby. But as he puts it back to the place where he found it, a policeman catches him and he instantly picks it back up. Still trying to get rid of the baby, he gives it to an old man who can barely walk and runs away. But the old man comes up with the same idea as Charlie did, he puts the baby inside the buggy of the woman. Unfortunately she realizes that the orphan was put in her baby carriage the moment Charlie walks past. She chases him down, beats him up and makes him take the baby. He has no other choice than to do so because the policeman appears again. Frustrated by the situation, Charlie sits down on the curb and even thinks of throwing the orphan in the drain. A few moments later, after finding a letter which says ""please love and care for this orphan child"", his mood suddenly lights up and he feels responsible. At the end he walks away with the baby and disappears in a small side street."

Wondering where it came from, he starts looking around. As he passes some trashcans, he finds a baby laying behind them. He picks it up and holds it close to him. He again starts looking around, now wondering who might left the baby on the floor. A few moments later, a mother with her child in a stroller walk by. He sees this as an opportunity to leave the baby to this mother and puts the baby to hers in the stroller. After realizing what Chaplin has done, the mother angrily tells him to take the baby back. As the mother turned him down, Chaplin just puts the baby back where he found it. In exact this moment, a police officer passes and just watches him. Chaplin realizes that he is being watched and therefore decides to pick the baby up again, so he will not get arrested. He now walks through the neighbor, looking for a solution. When he walks past by a random bystander, he asks him to hold the baby for a moment, but then starts running away and hides. The man who holds the baby now, is confused and puts the baby in the same stroller from the mother, from the beginning of the film. Chaplin, sure about his accomplishment, casually walks by the mother again, but she recognizes him and attacks Chaplin and drags him back to the stroller, asking him to take the baby back. They start to argue, but when the police officer passes again, Chaplin willingly takes the baby back, again to avoid a punishment. It now seems like, that Chaplin gave up. He sits down next to the road while holding the baby. He takes a closer look a founds a letter with the text ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". As he read the text he starts smiling and walks off with the baby in his hands."

Afterwards he will find an orphan baby and tries to get rid of it while encountering several persons yet without success. First you will see him try to give the kid to a woman with another child though she seems very unpleased. Also when he is trying to set it back onto the ground he will encounter an policeman preventing him from that. Afterwards he gives the baby to an man who seems to have trouble walking. This man puts the baby back into the cart of the woman from the beginning which will identify Cahrlie Chaplin as the culprit and punishes him aswell as giving him the kid back.		{'In': 1, 'the': 10, 'video': 1, 'you': 2, 'will': 5, 'see': 2, 'Charlie': 1, 'Chaplin': 2, 'being': 1, 'hit': 1, 'with': 2, 'some': 1, 'garbage': 1, '.': 6, 'Afterwards': 2, 'he': 4, 'find': 1, 'an': 3, 'orphan': 1, 'baby': 3, 'and': 2, 'tries': 1, 'to': 6, 'get': 1, 'rid': 1, 'of': 2, 'it': 2, 'while': 1, 'encountering': 1, 'several': 1, 'persons': 1, 'yet': 1, 'without': 1, 'success': 1, 'First': 1, 'him': 4, 'try': 1, 'give': 1, 'kid': 2, 'a': 1, 'woman': 2, 'another': 1, 'child': 1, 'though': 1, 'she': 1, 'seems': 2, 'very': 1, 'unpleased': 1, 'Also': 1, 'when': 1, 'is': 1, 'trying': 1, 'set': 1, 'back': 3, 'onto': 1, 'ground': 1, 'encounter': 1, 'policeman': 1, 'preventing': 1, 'from': 2, 'that': 1, 'gives': 1, 'man': 2, 'who': 1, 'have': 1, 'trouble': 1, 'walking': 1, 'This': 1, 'puts': 1, 'into': 1, 'cart': 1, 'beginning': 1, 'which': 1, 'identify': 1, 'Cahrlie': 1, 'as': 2, 'culprit': 1, 'punishes': 1, 'aswell': 1, 'giving': 1}	{'ADP': 14, 'DET': 17, 'NOUN': 21, 'PRON': 16, 'AUX': 8, 'VERB': 23, 'PROPN': 4, 'PUNCT': 6, 'ADV': 9, 'CCONJ': 2, 'PART': 4, 'SCONJ': 3, 'ADJ': 2}

Suddenly someone throws stuff and insults towards Chaplin. After that he pulls out a case and looks for a cigarette  and throws his gloves into a trash bin. After that he noticed a crying baby in the alley. While picking the baby up a woman with a stroller is walking past them. Chaplin notices the stroller and tries to put the baby in the stroller. The woman was furious as Chaplin said that she had dropped something. He had to pick the baby up again because it wasn't the baby of that woman. As Chaplin is trying to place the baby back into the alley a officer is walking by and so he's picking the baby back up. He then askes an elder man to hold the baby for a moment to tie his laces. While the elder man is holding the baby, Chaplin is making a run for it. He's hiding in the alley and the elder man passes by the stroller of the lady before. The elder man deploys the baby in the stroller and runs off. The woman noticed the other baby in the stroller as Chaplin was walking by and then she suckerpunched Chaplin with a umbrella. The officer also passed by and Chaplin took the baby and went off. He then sits down and considers to throw the baby in the sewerage.Chaplin notices a letter on the baby which said that someone should take care of the baby.

As someone throws his trash right where he is standing, he pauses, lights a cigarette and recognize a baby to his left lying on the ground. Meanwhile a woman with a stroller walks by and Chaplin assumes that the baby belongs to her. He lays it down in the stroller but when the woman sees him she gets angry and tells him to take the baby back. He then takes the child again and wants to put it back to where he found it, but because a policeman is watching him he leaves with the baby in his arms. After that he walks by an old man and ask him to hold the baby as he wants to tie up his shoe. But he is just pretending and leaves without the baby. The old man then walks through the streets, looking for a way to get rid of the baby. He sees a stroller, put the baby in it and leaves as well. The stroller is the one belonging to the woman Chaplin met before. When she gets out of the store she gets upset because the baby is back with her. At the same time, Charlie Chaplin walks by and she then assumes that he is responsible for it again and hits him with an umbrella. The police man joins the situation and Chaplin better leaves with the baby because the woman accuses him. Without knowing what to do he sits down on the curb. While he is looking at the baby he finds a piece of paper that states that someone should please love and take care of the orphan. Touched by this he stands up and leaves, holding the baby in his arms.		{'Charlie': 2, 'Chaplin': 5, 'is': 8, 'walking': 1, 'down': 3, 'a': 9, 'dirty': 1, 'alley': 1, 'while': 1, 'people': 1, 'are': 1, 'throwing': 1, 'their': 1, 'trash': 2, 'out': 2, 'of': 5, 'the': 25, 'window': 1, '.': 16, 'As': 1, 'someone': 2, 'throws': 1, 'his': 5, 'right': 1, 'where': 2, 'he': 12, 'standing': 1, ',': 7, 'pauses': 1, 'lights': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'and': 12, 'recognize': 1, 'baby': 12, 'to': 10, 'left': 1, 'lying': 1, 'on': 2, 'ground': 1, 'Meanwhile': 1, 'woman': 4, 'with': 5, 'stroller': 4, 'walks': 4, 'by': 4, 'assumes': 2, 'that': 5, 'belongs': 1, 'her': 2, 'He': 3, 'lays': 1, 'it': 5, 'in': 4, 'but': 2, 'when': 1, 'sees': 2, 'him': 6, 'she': 4, 'gets': 3, 'angry': 1, 'tells': 1, 'take': 2, 'back': 3, 'then': 3, 'takes': 1, 'child': 1, 'again': 2, 'wants': 2, 'put': 2, 'found': 1, 'because': 3, 'policeman': 1, 'watching': 1, 'leaves': 5, 'arms': 2, 'After': 1, 'an': 2, 'old': 2, 'man': 3, 'ask': 1, 'hold': 1, 'as': 2, 'tie': 1, 'up': 2, 'shoe': 1, 'But': 1, 'just': 1, 'pretending': 1, 'without': 1, 'The': 3, 'through': 1, 'streets': 1, 'looking': 2, 'for': 2, 'way': 1, 'get': 1, 'rid': 1, 'well': 1, 'one': 1, 'belonging': 1, 'met': 1, 'before': 1, 'When': 1, 'store': 1, 'upset': 1, 'At': 1, 'same': 1, 'time': 1, 'responsible': 1, 'hits': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'police': 1, 'joins': 1, 'situation': 1, 'better': 1, 'accuses': 1, 'Without': 1, 'knowing': 1, 'what': 1, 'do': 1, 'sits': 1, 'curb': 1, 'While': 1, 'at': 1, 'finds': 1, 'piece': 1, 'paper': 1, 'states': 1, 'should': 1, 'please': 1, 'love': 1, 'care': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'Touched': 1, 'this': 1, 'stands': 1, 'holding': 1}	{'PROPN': 7, 'AUX': 11, 'VERB': 56, 'ADP': 38, 'DET': 39, 'ADJ': 8, 'NOUN': 50, 'SCONJ': 14, 'PRON': 44, 'PUNCT': 23, 'CCONJ': 15, 'ADV': 15, 'PART': 6, 'NUM': 1}

After a few metres, he gets hit by bricks which seem to have been thrown down at him from someone in the house on the side of the street. Charlie Chaplin looks confused and tries to figure out who threw them at him. He then grabs a box with cigarettes and lights one with his show. While smoking, he takes closer looks at the surroundings and notices a baby on the ground, laying beside a garbage bin. Slowly, he approaches the bunch and looks at it, before taking it up and holding it in front of his face for closer inspection. He then searches for an opportunity to get rid of the baby and sees a woman with pram, which he then follows in order to lay down the baby in a moment when the woman does not pay attention to him. Unfortunately for him, she sees him and screams at him to take the child away. After that, Charlie Chaplin returns to the garbage bin and puts the baby back on the ground, when a police man appears behind him, urging him to take the baby back in his arms. Charlie Chaplin walks away and takes one last chance to get rid of the child when he gives it away to a beggar, before running away. The beggar looks confused, tries to follow him but can not manage to catch up. Instead, he passes the lady with the pram again, who again is not paying attention. The beggar puts the baby down in the pram, just like Charlie Chaplin did before, then walks away. At the same time when the lady enters the street again and discovers the second baby in the pram, Charlie Chaplin passes her. She confrontates him violently.

Charles has to move out of the way to not get hit. He continues walking while he's havin a smoke. He then gets hit by somebody else throwing out bricks. He dusts himself off and lights another cigarette. Afterwards he finds a baby laying on the floor which he wants to give to a woman who is strolling by with a trolley but it appears that it's not her kid. Charles takes the kid and wants to put it back where he found it. But a police officer walks by and gives him a warning look. Charles then picks the baby back up and continues walking. He passes an older gentleman, puts the baby in his arms and runs away to hide. The old man sees the trolley and puts the baby into it without the woman noticing and walks off. Next thing you see is Charles coming out of his hiding place. He walks past the woman who sees the baby back in her trolley and follows Charles and calls the police officer. Charles then takes the baby and continues his journey. He sits down and seems to think. He then finds a note in the baby's pocket which reads: Please love and care for this orphan child. He smiles at the baby and walks off the scene with the kid in his arms.

Chaplin is lucky and though all of the bricks get close to him, they never hit him. Finally a flowerpot hits him. Then he gets himself a cigarette, lights it and throws his gloves in a nearby trash can. That's when he sees a baby crying on the floor. He picks it up and puts it in the stroller of a woman walking by. The woman gets mad because it is not her baby. So Chaplin puts the baby back to where he found it earlier. A policeman observes him doing that and Chaplin has to pick up the baby again and walks away. When Chaplin sees another man, he gives the baby to him and implies to tie his shoes but then runs away. The other man chases Chaplin, who is hiding. When he cannot find Chaplin he puts the baby in the unattended stroller which could be seen earlier. When the woman comes out of a house and sees another baby in her stroller she is confused und angry. Right then Chaplin walks by and the woman chases after him and hits him with her umbrella. They argue until the policeman shows up again. Chaplin takes the child und tries to figure out what to do. He finds a note with the baby, asking to take care of the child and love it. So finally Chaplin smiles and keeps the baby.

A police officer appears and watches him curiously. Chaplin has no other choice but to take the baby again in his arms and to walk around the corner.

Chaplin	written_online	45.0	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (German/English), Spellchecker	The film starts with Charlie Chaplin walking between two big scabby building complexes while someone else is throwing recklessly bricks out of the window from the first floor without noticing Charlie Chaplin passing. Chaplin continues walking until he finally is hit by the litter of someone else's dustbin. Between garbage cans, he eventually notices a crying baby, wrapped up in a cloth, which someone must have left there on purpose. Chaplin picks the baby up and looks for someone to whom the baby might belong to. Eventually, a woman passes while pushing a pram with a baby inside. Chaplin assumes that the baby he found on the floor belongs to her and that she obviously must have dropped it without noticing. However, she makes clear that it is not hers and also feels rather offended by Chaplin's assumption. Chaplin takes the baby out of the pram and intends to lay it back to the place where he found it. He stays not unnoticed though as a policeman watches Chaplin. So instead of getting help by the officer, Chaplin prefers to take the baby with him and obviously wants to drop it somewhere else. Then an old stranger with a walking stick comes in handy and Chaplin gives the baby to him and runs away afterwards. The old man,  however, does not want to keep it and is desperately looking for Chaplin to return the baby but without any success. When the old man sees a pram left alone in front of a shop, he sees his chance to get rid of it and finally puts the baby in the pram. As the woman, to whom the pram belongs to, comes out of the shop and notices the  baby she suspects Chaplin again who is, unfortunately, passing the pram right at that moment. After all, Chaplin is given back the baby and keeps it after he found a tag lying between the layers of the cloth saying that the baby is an orphan and needs someone to love and care for it.

He picks it up and not knowing what do do with it puts it into a womans‘ baby carriage who was walking by. The woman catches Chaplin trying to put the baby next to her own baby and reacts angry. She moves on and Charlie puts the baby back on the ground where he found it but the moment he turns around and sees a police officer behind him who witnessed this scene, he picks the baby up again and walks on. He spots an older man with a walking stick and asks him to hold the baby in order to tie his shoe but then runs away. The man sees the womans‘ baby carriage as well and puts the baby in it. Unfortunately, the moment Chaplin walks past the womens‘ carriage, she discovers the baby and assuming that Chaplin has put it again in the carriage, starts hitting him with her umbrella. The police officer walks towards them and wanting to avoid a conflict with him, Charlie takes the baby and runs off. Finally, he sits down on a curb with the baby in his arms. He discovers a draining grid and looks at the baby as if he was thinking about putting it in there.Then, he notices a note in the babys‘ clothes which says that the baby is an orphan and demands the finder to love and care for the child. This seems to change Chaplin‘s mind. He holds the baby tight to his chest and walks happily away.		{'While': 1, 'walking': 3, ' ': 1, 'down': 3, 'an': 3, 'alley': 1, 'and': 16, 'being': 1, 'several': 1, 'times': 1, 'hit': 1, 'by': 2, 'debris': 1, 'seeming': 1, 'to': 11, 'fall': 1, 'from': 1, 'the': 22, 'houses': 1, 'rooftops': 1, ',': 8, 'Charlie': 3, 'Chaplin': 4, 'stops': 1, 'light': 1, 'a': 10, 'cigarette': 1, 'discovers': 3, 'baby': 15, 'lying': 1, 'on': 5, 'ground': 2, 'right': 1, 'next': 2, 'dustbin': 1, '.': 13, 'He': 4, 'picks': 2, 'it': 7, 'up': 2, 'not': 1, 'knowing': 1, 'what': 1, 'do': 2, 'with': 5, 'puts': 3, 'into': 1, 'womans': 2, '‘': 4, 'carriage': 4, 'who': 2, 'was': 2, 'The': 3, 'woman': 1, 'catches': 1, 'trying': 1, 'put': 2, 'her': 2, 'own': 1, 'reacts': 1, 'angry': 1, 'She': 1, 'moves': 1, 'back': 1, 'where': 1, 'he': 6, 'found': 1, 'but': 2, 'moment': 2, 'turns': 1, 'around': 1, 'sees': 2, 'police': 2, 'officer': 2, 'behind': 1, 'him': 4, 'witnessed': 1, 'this': 1, 'scene': 1, 'again': 2, 'walks': 4, 'spots': 1, 'older': 1, 'man': 2, 'stick': 1, 'asks': 1, 'hold': 1, 'in': 6, 'order': 1, 'tie': 1, 'his': 3, 'shoe': 1, 'then': 1, 'runs': 2, 'away': 2, 'as': 2, 'well': 1, 'Unfortunately': 1, 'past': 1, 'womens': 1, 'she': 1, 'assuming': 1, 'that': 2, 'has': 1, 'starts': 1, 'hitting': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'towards': 1, 'them': 1, 'wanting': 1, 'avoid': 1, 'conflict': 1, 'takes': 1, 'off': 1, 'Finally': 1, 'sits': 1, 'curb': 1, 'arms': 1, 'draining': 1, 'grid': 1, 'looks': 1, 'at': 1, 'if': 1, 'thinking': 1, 'about': 1, 'putting': 1, 'there': 1, 'Then': 1, 'notices': 1, 'note': 1, 'babys': 1, 'clothes': 1, 'which': 1, 'says': 1, 'is': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'demands': 1, 'finder': 1, 'love': 1, 'care': 1, 'for': 1, 'child': 1, 'This': 1, 'seems': 1, 'change': 1, 'Chaplin‘s': 1, 'mind': 1, 'holds': 1, 'tight': 1, 'chest': 1, 'happily': 1}	{'SCONJ': 6, 'VERB': 59, 'SPACE': 1, 'ADP': 35, 'DET': 39, 'NOUN': 57, 'CCONJ': 18, 'AUX': 6, 'ADJ': 5, 'PART': 9, 'PUNCT': 25, 'PROPN': 8, 'ADV': 17, 'PRON': 34}

However, he doesn't seem to care and keeps on walking while he smokes a cigarette. Suddenly, as Chaplin walks by a garbage bin, someone throws trash out of an apartment, which is probably meant to fall into the bin but misses it and falls on the comedian instead. He loses his cigarette but instantly reaches out for another one in his pocket.  <br/> A baby lies hidden next to a different garbage bin in the same backstreet and as Charles Chaplin notices it, he thinks that someone threw the baby out of a window aswell.  <br/> A woman with a baby carriage crosses his way and he says ""Pardon me, you dropped something"". But the woman explains that it isn't her baby.  <br/> During his try to put the baby back to its hiding spot, a policeman walks by and seems angry about it.  <br/> Charles takes the baby and walks down a different street and asks an old man to hold it since he has to retie his shoe. <br/> However, he takes his chance and runs away. The old man tries to follow him and walks by the same baby carriage as Charles did before. He lies the baby down next to the other baby and leaves.  <br/> Charles Chaplin leaves his hiding spot and accidentally crosses the woman with the baby carriage. The woman hits him with an umbrella and forces him to take the baby again. <br/> At the end, he sits down on a sidewalk next to a drain and thinks about hiding the baby in there.  <br/> After all, Chaplin pulls a letter out of the baby's blanket, which says ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". He glances at the baby and seems very happy as he stands up and walks away from the scene."

Chaplin	written_online	30.0	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (German/English)	The location in the video presented is a street or a backyard, in which several bins are standing next to the walls. In the back a person is throwing things out of the window. A person, presumably Charly Chaplin, walks underneath that window. He realises the things falling down from above, but is not noticeably disturbed by it. He starts smoking and moves into the foreground. Then again, things are falling down from above. A text appears: 'Awkward ass'. Charly Chaplin takes a look into the bin next to him. He pulls a cigarette out of a metal box and puts it into his mouth. The, he takes off his gloves and lits the cigarette. He throws his gloves into the bin. Following his view, we can see a baby laying on the ground next to a wall. Chaplin watches out for people. He picks up the baby and moves into the back. He raises his arm to get the attention of a woman passing by. We see a buggy. Charly Chaplin puts the baby into the buggy. The woman appears and both argue, presumably about who is going to take care of the baby. Charly takes the baby out of the buggy and both persons leave in different directions. As Charly lays down the baby, a policeman arrives. Charly turns around, spots the policeman and picks the baby up again. In a different location we can see a man walking next to Chaplin. Charly indicates that he wants to tie his shoelaces and hands the baby over to the man. Then he runs into the back. The man follows Charly, who hides in a garage. The man lays the baby down into another buggy, in which we can also spot another baby. Then he leaves. Charly comes out of his stash, running into the policeman. He is passing by the buggy with the two babys. The same woman from earlier comes out of a house, sees Charly and follows him. She hits him with an umbrella and then drags him towards the buggy. They start arguing again. The policeman notices the two people arguing. Charly takes the baby out of the buggy again and leaves. He sits down on the sidewalk, shortly considering to throw the baby down the drain. He finds a note in the baby's clothes and reads: 'Please love and care for this orphan child'. Then he looks at the baby and takes it with him.

Chaplin	written_online	14.0	Outside classroom		Charlie Chaplin is walking through a street in an industrial area of a town, which is shown by old brick buildings and a lot of trash that is laying all over the street. He grabs into his pocket, pulls out a little box and takes out a cigarette, which he shoves into his mouth. In this moment, he notices a baby laying besides one of the trash cans. He looks around, looking for the parents or any other person, who is responsible for the child. He sees a lady walking by, stops her and puts the baby inside her wagon. The woman is not happy about it and tells him to get the baby out of her wagon, because it is obviously not hers. A policeman is standing beside Chaplin, as he tries to lay the baby back to where he found it, but takes it back from the ground, as he notices that he is being watched by him. Chaplin proceeds trying to find someone, who will take care of the baby, but no one seems to be responsible. In the end, Chaplin sits at the sidewalk and reads a letter, which is attached to the babys blanket. Written there is a begging to whoever finds the child in the street, asking the finder to take care of it, because it's an orphan. Chaplin smiles and walks away, with the baby in his arms.

The scene starts with Chaplin accidentally discovering a abandoned baby on the side of a street. During the video he continuously tries to get rid of the baby. <br/> First, he puts it in a baby carriage to another baby, but the mother makes him take the abandoned child back again. After that, he tries to put it back where he found it, but a policeman notices Chaplin, so he quickly takes the child with him again. Later, he gives the baby to an old man, acting like he has to tie his shoes, but then he hastily runs away and hides. The old man then puts the baby into the carriage of the mom from the scene before. She comes out of a shop, sees the strange baby and then Chaplin and starts to drag him back to the carriage. The policeman approaches and they both make Chaplin take the child back. He then sits down with the baby on his arm and considers throwing it down a drain, but then finds a note in the child's cloth. It reads ""please love and care for the orphan child"". He then smiles at it and takes it with him."

He then thinks he has found her, puts the baby in a stroller that belongs to a woman. However, this is not the right mother, so she gets a little angry and he takes the baby back: unfortunately, he takes the wrong baby out of the stroller. He puts the baby back on the floor where he found it before, being watched by a police officer. That's the reason why he decides not to leave the baby and instead gives it to another man. This man leaves it in the stroller where Chaplin had put the baby before too. The woman gets furious and tells the officer. The officer makes Chaplin keep the baby, so that is why the scene ends with Chaplin holding the baby, actually being happy and caring about it.

A woman with a stroller walks past him and Charlie assumes, the baby he found must be hers. The woman is in rage and claims, that the baby is not hers. Charlie picks up the baby out of the stroller and leaves. He wants to put the baby next to the trash cans where he found it but a police officer comes by and Charlie picks the baby up again and leaves the street corner. He is walking down another street past an old man. He pretends to deal with his shoe laces, forcing the baby on the old man and is then running away. The old man is following him und he sees a stroller, which is the stoller of the woman Charlie met before.  <br/> In the next scene Charlie is stepping out is hiding place and promptly bumbs into the police officer. He quickly turns around and walks down the street, past the stroller with the lost baby. The woman sees the baby and is running after Charlie. She hits him with her umbrella and is dragging him back to the stroller. They have an argument until the police officer appears. Charlie takes the baby back and sits down with him on the kerb. He thinks about dropping it down a drainbut is deciding against it. He finds a piece of paper in the baby's clothing on which is written, that the orphan baby shall be loved and cared for. Charlie then walks away with the baby.

After being hit with rubbish for the second time he comes to a hold, pulling out another cigarette from a small box. He lights the cigarette and throws his gloves away. Suddenly, he spots a baby wrapped in clothes on the ground. Chaplin looks around trying to figure out where the baby comes from. Eventually, a woman with a baby buggy passes by. Chaplin tries to give her the child but she refuses to keep it. He walks off. Wanting to place the baby where he found it, a police man catches him which forces Chaplin to pick it up once again. He then gives the baby to a man with a walking stick who is not able to follow Chaplin that quickly. <br/> However, the man finds the baby buggy of the woman Chaplin met earlier and places the baby inside of it. Coming out of his stash, Chaplin passes the woman and her buggy. She accuses him of giving her the foreign baby and hits him with an umbrella several times.

A woman throws something out of the window, but Charlie walks on unconcerned. Farther into the lane he finally gets hit by some rubbish someone threw out of the window. Hence his cigar fell on the ground, he takes a new one out of his tiny metal box, which he carries in his chest pocket. When he throws his gloves away he suddenly sees a baby lying on the ground between the rubbish. He picks the baby up and tries to pass it to a woman with a carriage, that randomly passes by. Since the baby does not belong to her, she forces Charlie to take it back. Charlie does not know what to do with the baby, so he tries to put it back where he found it. Unfortunately, a policeman comes by so Charlie is not able to drop it in the lane. Ich tricks an old man into holding the baby and runs away. The man leaves the baby in the woman’s carriage, who is nor amused about it and thinks Charlie left it there. As he passes by the woman forces him to take the baby with him by calling for the policeman. Charlie is clueless about what to do with the baby, so he sits down on the sidewalk and while playing around he finds a letter, that says “please love and care for this orphan child”. Charlie is affected by the letter and decides to care for the baby.		{'Charlie': 8, 'Chaplin': 1, 'is': 5, 'walking': 1, 'along': 1, 'a': 8, 'street': 1, ',': 11, 'smoking': 1, 'cigar': 2, '.': 14, 'A': 1, 'woman': 4, 'throws': 2, 'something': 1, 'out': 3, 'of': 3, 'the': 20, 'window': 2, 'but': 1, 'walks': 1, 'on': 4, 'unconcerned': 1, 'Farther': 1, 'into': 2, 'lane': 2, 'he': 10, 'finally': 1, 'gets': 1, 'hit': 1, 'by': 6, 'some': 1, 'rubbish': 2, 'someone': 1, 'threw': 1, 'Hence': 1, 'his': 4, 'fell': 1, 'ground': 2, 'takes': 1, 'new': 1, 'one': 1, 'tiny': 1, 'metal': 1, 'box': 1, 'which': 1, 'carries': 1, 'in': 3, 'chest': 1, 'pocket': 1, 'When': 1, 'gloves': 1, 'away': 2, 'suddenly': 1, 'sees': 1, 'baby': 9, 'lying': 1, 'between': 1, 'He': 1, 'picks': 1, 'up': 1, 'and': 6, 'tries': 2, 'to': 10, 'pass': 1, 'it': 7, 'with': 4, 'carriage': 2, 'that': 2, 'randomly': 1, 'passes': 2, 'Since': 1, 'does': 2, 'not': 3, 'belong': 1, 'her': 1, 'she': 1, 'forces': 2, 'take': 2, 'back': 2, 'know': 1, 'what': 2, 'do': 2, 'so': 3, 'put': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'Unfortunately': 1, 'policeman': 2, 'comes': 1, 'able': 1, 'drop': 1, 'Ich': 1, 'tricks': 1, 'an': 1, 'old': 1, 'man': 2, 'holding': 1, 'runs': 1, 'The': 1, 'leaves': 1, '’s': 1, 'who': 1, 'nor': 1, 'amused': 1, 'about': 2, 'thinks': 1, 'left': 1, 'there': 1, 'As': 1, 'him': 2, 'calling': 1, 'for': 3, 'clueless': 1, 'sits': 1, 'down': 1, 'sidewalk': 1, 'while': 1, 'playing': 1, 'around': 1, 'finds': 1, 'letter': 2, 'says': 1, '“': 1, 'please': 1, 'love': 1, 'care': 2, 'this': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'child': 1, '”': 1, 'affected': 1, 'decides': 1}	{'PROPN': 9, 'AUX': 9, 'VERB': 47, 'ADP': 37, 'DET': 33, 'NOUN': 40, 'PUNCT': 27, 'PRON': 34, 'CCONJ': 8, 'ADJ': 7, 'ADV': 14, 'SCONJ': 5, 'PART': 12, 'INTJ': 1}

This changes after he walks along a bin, where a person throws their rubbish into but hits him. After that he finally sees the orphan but does not know what to do with it. First of all, he looks at it and then picks it up. But then he does not seem like he knows what to do with it. In the background a woman with her own child in a pushchair appears and the man tries to put the baby into it. This woman does not accept his act and forces him to take back that child. So he takes it back and tries to put it back at the place where he found it and picked it up. Eventually a police officer is standing right behind him and so he has to take the baby again. While running away from the officer he comes across an older man to whom he hands the orphan. This old man takes the baby then, but does not know what to do with it either. While he walks with the baby in his arms he sees a woman with a pushchair, who is the same one where the first man tried to put the baby at, and puts it into it and leaves unwatched. In the next moment the first man comes across the street and the woman sees the baby with her baby again, so she shouts at him and causes therefore the man to take the baby back. So he has got the baby and does still not know what to do. After a short walk he sits down at the kerbside and hugs the baby. In this moment he finds a note, which says that this baby needs to be loved because it is an orphan. This causes that the man cuddles the baby and takes it with him, in the end.		{'The': 1, 'short': 2, 'movie': 1, 'shows': 1, 'a': 11, 'situation': 1, 'of': 2, 'man': 8, 'who': 2, 'finds': 2, 'an': 3, 'orphan': 4, 'baby': 14, '.': 18, 'At': 1, 'first': 3, 'he': 16, 'walks': 3, 'towards': 1, 'the': 27, 'but': 4, 'does': 6, 'not': 6, 'see': 1, 'it': 15, 'This': 4, 'changes': 1, 'after': 1, 'along': 1, 'bin': 1, ',': 8, 'where': 3, 'person': 1, 'throws': 1, 'their': 1, 'rubbish': 1, 'into': 3, 'hits': 1, 'him': 5, 'After': 2, 'that': 4, 'finally': 1, 'sees': 3, 'know': 3, 'what': 4, 'to': 12, 'do': 4, 'with': 8, 'First': 1, 'all': 1, 'looks': 1, 'at': 5, 'and': 13, 'then': 3, 'picks': 1, 'up': 2, 'But': 1, 'seem': 1, 'like': 1, 'knows': 1, 'In': 3, 'background': 1, 'woman': 4, 'her': 2, 'own': 1, 'child': 2, 'in': 3, 'pushchair': 2, 'appears': 1, 'tries': 2, 'put': 3, 'accept': 1, 'his': 2, 'act': 1, 'forces': 1, 'take': 3, 'back': 4, 'So': 2, 'takes': 3, 'place': 1, 'found': 1, 'picked': 1, 'Eventually': 1, 'police': 1, 'officer': 2, 'is': 3, 'standing': 1, 'right': 1, 'behind': 1, 'so': 2, 'has': 2, 'again': 2, 'While': 2, 'running': 1, 'away': 1, 'from': 1, 'comes': 2, 'across': 2, 'older': 1, 'whom': 1, 'hands': 1, 'old': 1, 'either': 1, 'arms': 1, 'same': 1, 'one': 1, 'tried': 1, 'puts': 1, 'leaves': 1, 'unwatched': 1, 'next': 1, 'moment': 2, 'street': 1, 'she': 1, 'shouts': 1, 'causes': 2, 'therefore': 1, 'got': 1, 'still': 1, 'walk': 1, 'sits': 1, 'down': 1, 'kerbside': 1, 'hugs': 1, 'this': 2, 'note': 1, 'which': 1, 'says': 1, 'needs': 1, 'be': 1, 'loved': 1, 'because': 1, 'cuddles': 1, 'end': 1}	{'DET': 48, 'ADJ': 10, 'NOUN': 55, 'VERB': 58, 'ADP': 37, 'PRON': 53, 'PUNCT': 26, 'ADV': 21, 'CCONJ': 18, 'AUX': 11, 'PART': 18, 'SCONJ': 10}

Thereupon the disgruntled vagabond pulls out a cigarette and starts smoking. Looking to his left he finds a crying new born lying next to a bin. Charlie looks around in order to find out where the baby came from. At that very second a mother pushing a pram passes him. Accordingly, Charlie supposes that the new born belongs to her and puts it in the pram. However, it turns out that the lady is not the baby's mother since she is beside herself with rage. So Charlie takes the baby back. In his desperation he lays the child back on the ground which is seen by a police officer. Again he picks up the new born and hands it to an old man walking down the lane. Charlie grasps his chance, runs off and hides himself. The old man, not knowing what to do, puts the baby back in the pram on the street. The unwitting and relieved Charlie continues his walk down the street and passes the aforesaid pram. The mother discovers the stranger's child, runs after him and hits him with her umbrella. The fight catches the police officer's attention and Charlie picks up the baby. He's sitting down on the pavement, thinking about how to get rid of the child when he finds a note, apparently written by the baby's mother. The note says to please love and care for the orphan which Charlie finally decides to do.

In doing so he suddenly sees a baby lying next to a trash bin. He looks around to find out where the baby could come from. He lifts the baby up and notices a woman pushing a pram. Chaplin considers the woman to be the baby's mother and therefore he follows her and puts the baby into the pram. There is another baby already in there, though. The woman gets mad and makes Chaplin leave and take the child with him. Chaplin tries to get rid of the baby and puts it next to the trash bin where he has found it. At the same time a police officer passes by and Chaplin lifts the baby up again. Then he passes the baby to an old man he meets in the streets, pretending to having to tie his shoe. He runs away and hides from the man. However, the old man cannot find Chaplin but sees a pram standing in front of a shop. There is another baby already in it and the man puts the baby into the pram next to the other child. When a woman leaves the shop it turns out to be the same pram which Chaplin has tried to put the baby into shortly before. Chaplin leaves his hiding place and passes the pram. The mother recognizes him, thinks he was the one who put the baby into the pram again, follows him and hits him with an umbrella. She tries to make him take the baby but he refuses until the police officer arrives whom Chaplin has met before. Chaplin takes the baby, leaves and sits down at a footpath. Next to him there is a drain and he considers whether to put the baby into it but he decides against this.When frisking the cloths the baby has been wrapped in he finds a piece of paper. The letter says that the baby was an orphan and begs the finder to love and take care of it. Chaplin smiles and cuddles the baby and leaves with the baby on his arms.

As he feels obliged to take care of the baby and cannot leave it lying next to a dustbin, he secretly tries to give it to a woman who passes with a pram and her own baby. This attempt to rid himself of the baby fails and thus the protagonist even considers to simply return the baby to the backyard where he found it. However, a police officer watches him and so he gives it to another man who then himself places the unwanted baby in the woman's pram. She suspects the protagonist and accuses him in front of the officer, which results in the protagonist's flight. As he eventually sits down, he finds and reads a piece of paper which was wrapped in the baby's blankets. This note declares that whoever finds this orphan child should care for it.

Once he is out on the streets he nearly gets hit two times by garbage, thrown out of the window above him. After lighting his cigarre he comes across an abandoned baby, lying on the ground beside him. He lifts the baby into his arms and notices a woman walking by with a pram. Mr Chaplin assumes that the baby belonges to her and lays it down into the pram. the women however rejects the baby since it does not belong to her. The protagonist then tries to leave the baby at the spot he found it. A policeman observed his crime and instructs him to keep the baby. Mr Chaplin then gives the baby to an old man he passes and immadeatly leaves. The old man, just as Mr Chaplin, lays down the baby into the same woman's pram and escapes rapidly. After noticing the baby in her pram she spots Mr Chaplin passing her and gives him the baby back with help from the policeman.

After ligthing up a cigar he spots a baby on the ground. He picks it up just when a mother with a pram passes by and appears to be looking for something. Chaplin, in good intent, thinks the kid belongs to her and puts it into the pram, only to find out that the baby is not affiliated with the woman. He then picks it up once again but soon finds himself wanting to leave the baby behind. In order to to that he hands the baby a passer who, in turn, seeks to get rid of the unwanted ""gift"". He then, just like Chaplin, discovers the pram of the woman, to drop the kid off and walk away quickly. As Chaplin walks by the woman by accident, she beats him up and insits on him taking the baby with him.

He seems disturbed and takes a break by getting an already half-lit cigarette from a box and starts smoking. During his smoke, Chaplin notices a Baby lying on the floor. As he picks it up, he sees a Woman walking behind him with a buggy and comes to the conclusion, that the baby must be hers. But as he puts the baby next to the one, who is already occupying the buggy, the mother is telling him, that the baby he found isn't hers. So he wants to put the baby back, where he found it, but a police officer walks by and stops him. Due to the officer, Chaplin runs away with the baby but cheekily tries to give it to a stranger. But soon the baby is back in Chaplins arms.

He proceeds to place the baby into the stroller when the woman becomes mad and demands for him to take it back out, which Chaplin does. He then puts the baby back where he found it just when a police officer walks by. Upon seeing the other man, Chaplin picks up the baby immediately and leaves. Walking around with the baby, he finds an old man whom he gives the baby under the impression of having to lace his shoes, when suddenly he runs away. The old man, certainly as unbothered by the small child, happens to run into the stroller of the woman as well, placing the baby into it then and walking away from the scene. Chaplin meanwhile unintentionally runs into the woman and the stroller again, who becomes mad at an instant and demands him to take out ""his"" baby. The police officer happens to stand close by. Realizing this, Chaplin takes the baby and leaves. In the next scene, Chaplin sits down, looking defeated, the child in his arms. He finds a letter of a simple request: to take care of the orphan and to love it. Chaplin smiles at the child and walks off with it."

He walks by a house as someone from the first floor throws out several items. Close to some barrels at the end of the alley he stops and lights himself a cigarette. Looking to the side, he sees a baby laying next to one of the barrels. He advances towards the small human being and lifts it up. In the very same moment a woman walks by pushing a child's pushchair in front of her. He runs after her, however, before being able to reach her, the woman enters the building in the alley from which the items where thrown. Carles Chaplin then puts the baby into the pushchair. Meanwhile, the woman exits the house and observes Chaplin's action. Angrily, she approaches him, and the only thing that the recipient can see is a black screen with the words: ""Pardon me, you've dropped something"". The woman steams up and furiously says something that cannot be heard. Chaplin then almost takes the wrong baby out of the pushchair. However, he is reminded by the woman that he took the wrong human being. He puts it back, takes the baby that he found next to the barrels and walks away. The barrels is the place where he goes to next, to return the baby. A police man appears, stops with a stern look on his face and Charles Chaplin takes the small creature back into his arms and followingly he is seen in a different street. Here, another man with a walking aid can be perceived. Chaplin puts the baby into the man's arms and runs away. Carrying th baby, the man follows him. However, Chaplin manages to hide in a shed. The man who carries the baby runs onto the main street where he sees th pushchair next to a shop, puts the baby in and walks away. Chaplin advances out of the shed, walks onto the main street, passes the pushchair and in that very moment the woman comes out of the store, notices Charles Chaplin, runs after him, beats him up with her umbrella until he accords to go back to the pushchair and takes the baby. He walks a few meters, sits down at a sidewalk next to a manhole cover and perceives it. He then is thinking about dropping the baby into the manhole cover opening. However, he finds a note in the baby's clothing that states:""Please love and care for the orphan child"" He puts the note into his pocket, makes a loving gesture towards the child, smiles, stands up and walks away.

In the first third of this video, Charlie strolls through a dusty neighbourhood and gets hit by some neighbours' rubbish, he just brushes off his arm and continues walking. Suddenly another heap of dirt is thrown onto Charlie from above and extinguishes his cigarette. In the second third of the video Charlie finds a baby in a corner and wonders where it was coming from. He takes it and immediately searches for someone to take over the baby. He puts the baby in a pram of another mother coming along saying he found something she had dropped. She feels offended and he has to take the baby back. With the attention of putting the baby back in the corner where he found it, he wanders off. Then, a policeman watches him and he takes the baby again. As Charlie sees another older man walking around he tries trick him by handing him over the baby acting as if he wants to do up his shoelaces and needs a free hand. As soon as the man takes the baby, Charlie runs away and the older man puts the baby in the pram of the mother Charlie has just offended a few moments earlier. The woman thinks it was Charlie's fault again and canes him. Charlie walks away with the baby again to avoid trouble with the policeman and he starts to think about other solutions to get rid of the baby.

The first person he met was a nanny of another Baby, who he thought, could be the nanny of the Baby he found too. She denied it in a not very friendly manner and forced him to take the Baby back. He then tried to lay the Baby back in the streets but while doing so he was interupted by a police officer. Shortly after he met an old man, who he kindly asked to hold the Baby for a minute, and ran off. Unfortunetaly the old man passed the Lady with the other Baby again and put the Baby in her stroller. She then recognized Charlie in the streets shortly after and, joined by the same police officer, who entered the scenery due to coincidence, Charlie had no choice but to take the Baby back. The film comes to a close when Charlie found a letter with the Baby saying that somebody please love the orphan child. The final scene of the film shows Charlie adopting the baby eventually."

It deals with the issue of responsibility. The protagonist Charlie suddenly finds a baby in an absent corner beside some bins. He takes the baby and tries to hand it to several other people which he meets on the streets. As he does not know to whom the baby belongs, he hands it to several other passer-bys. For instance, Charlie tries to put the baby into a baby buggy of a woman, who reacts impulsive and aggressive. She hands the baby straight back to him. To conclude, he does not know where to take the baby, for all his tries to get rid of the newborn failed. Therefore he sits down with it and finds a small letter. In this letter it is written that the writer of it could not take care of the baby and hopes that somebody would take care instead. By this, the short clip ended."

Chaplin	written_online	30.0	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (German/English)	In a rather trash-filled ally, were people do not care about the waste and trash they are throwing out of the window on the streets, the Tramp, played by actor Charles Chaplin is taking a walk. A few moments later he finds a little baby, wrapped in blankets laying on the ground in a little corner. Chaplin looks up to the balcony which causes for comedic effect. He seems to think that someone had thrown out their child, just like they are throwing out trash out of the balcony. He immediatly takes the baby and tries to find it's mother or father. He tries to find someone he can give the baby to. After seeing a woman with a stroller, he assumes that the baby belongs to the woman eventhough there was already a baby in the stroller. He carefully places the child in the stroller and tries to get out of the situation as politely as possible. He even says: ''you dropped something'' and is tipping his head, like he has done something admirable. But the woman is not accepting that child and gives the baby back to Chaplin. His second idea is to simply place the baby back to where he found it. On the street, right next to a trash can. This plan is quickly interrupted by the police officer passing by. He is not asking why Chaplin is trying to put the baby there, he simply gives him a look and Chaplin takes the baby and goes away. His third plan is to give the baby to a man he sees on the street. He told the man that he has to tie his shoe and as soon as the man takes the child, Chaplin runs away. The man, holding the baby in his arms sees the woman with the stroller and, like Chaplin just places the baby in the stroller and runs away. Chaplin is passing by that woman a moment later and she immediatly recognizes him and is furious. She even smacks him on his head and gives him back the baby. In that moment, the tramp was visibly desperate. He did not know what to do with the baby so he just sat on the sidewalk. Unwrapping the child a little bit, he discovers a note that says ''love this orphan child''. After that he gives the baby a little hug, gets up and goes his own way. He is not looking for anyone he can give the baby anymore. He is taking it with him.

He proceeds on his way smoking a cigarette when suddenly a pile of rubble falls down on him from above. Seemingly annoyed he looks for another cigarette as his previous one fell on the floor with the rubble. Before he starts to continue walking he spots a baby on the side of a building, he acts confused and it seems as he were looking for the child's parents. He then sees a woman walking by with a buggy. The woman leaves the buggy standing by the side of a building to go inside, Charles Chaplin uses the time to put the child he found in the buggy next to the woman's but she caught him in the act and asks him angrily to remove the second child from the buggy. He now looks for other ways to get rid of the child, at first, he tries to put it back where he found it but a policeman sees it, afterwards he hands it to another man he sees walking around. Said man now looks for a place for the child in Charles Chaplin's place, sees the woman's unattended buggy and places the child in it. Mr. Chaplin, now happy that he does no longer have to look after the child, walks past the building next to which the buggy still stands. The woman comes back to the buggy and sees the second, unwanted child. She wonders where it came from and sees Charles Chaplin. She runs after him and beats him up with her umbrella, forcing him to take back the child. Mr. Chaplin walks away with the child and sits down on the kerb. He sees a sewer next to him and thinks about dropping the child in it. He does not seem very convinced of this idea though, so he takes a closer look at the child.

He stops and pulls a box out of his jacket and lights another cigarette. While doing this, he sees a crying baby lying behind a trash can. He does not know what to do and picks it up. He then sees a woman with a pram and thinks the baby must be hers. After he followed her and put the baby in her pram, she gets angry because it is not her baby and Chaplin has to take the baby with him again. He then lays the baby behind the trash can where he has found it. It that moment a police man arrives and sees Chaplin. He is forced to pick the baby up again. He tricks a man into holding the baby and then runs away. The man follows him while Chaplin hides. The man puts the baby in the pram of the same woman Chaplin met earlier. He then runs away and leaves the baby in the pram. Chaplin, who flees from the police man, walks right past the pram, when the woman returns and sees the baby. She thinks that Chaplin put the baby there a second time and attacks him. He has to take on the child again. When he is sitting down with it he finds a note which reads that he should take care and love the orphaned baby. He smiles and leaves with the baby.		{'Chaplin': 8, 'walks': 2, 'down': 2, 'a': 12, 'street': 1, 'along': 1, 'row': 1, 'of': 3, 'houses': 1, 'when': 2, 'man': 6, 'drops': 1, 'trash': 3, 'from': 2, 'the': 21, 'windows': 1, 'which': 2, 'lands': 1, 'directly': 1, 'on': 2, '.': 18, 'He': 9, 'stops': 1, 'and': 13, 'pulls': 1, 'box': 1, 'out': 1, 'his': 1, 'jacket': 1, 'lights': 1, 'another': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'While': 1, 'doing': 1, 'this': 1, ',': 5, 'he': 6, 'sees': 4, 'crying': 1, 'baby': 14, 'lying': 1, 'behind': 2, 'can': 2, 'does': 1, 'not': 2, 'know': 1, 'what': 1, 'to': 4, 'do': 1, 'picks': 1, 'it': 4, 'up': 2, 'then': 4, 'woman': 3, 'with': 4, 'pram': 5, 'thinks': 2, 'must': 1, 'be': 1, 'hers': 1, 'After': 1, 'followed': 1, 'her': 3, 'put': 2, 'in': 3, 'she': 1, 'gets': 1, 'angry': 1, 'because': 1, 'is': 3, 'has': 3, 'take': 3, 'him': 3, 'again': 3, 'lays': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'It': 1, 'that': 3, 'moment': 1, 'police': 2, 'arrives': 1, 'forced': 1, 'pick': 1, 'tricks': 1, 'into': 1, 'holding': 1, 'runs': 2, 'away': 2, 'The': 2, 'follows': 1, 'while': 1, 'hides': 1, 'puts': 1, 'same': 1, 'met': 1, 'earlier': 1, 'leaves': 2, 'who': 1, 'flees': 1, 'right': 1, 'past': 1, 'returns': 1, 'She': 1, 'there': 1, 'second': 1, 'time': 1, 'attacks': 1, 'child': 1, 'When': 1, 'sitting': 1, 'finds': 1, 'note': 1, 'reads': 1, 'should': 1, 'care': 1, 'love': 1, 'orphaned': 1, 'smiles': 1}	{'PROPN': 8, 'VERB': 52, 'ADP': 23, 'DET': 37, 'NOUN': 47, 'SCONJ': 10, 'PRON': 35, 'ADV': 14, 'PUNCT': 23, 'CCONJ': 13, 'AUX': 8, 'PART': 6, 'ADJ': 3}

Chaplin	written_online	20.0	Outside classroom	Spellchecker	In the movie clip Charles Chaplin is on a stroll when he finds a crying baby lying on the floor of a lonely alleyway. Chaplin is confused and when in that very same moment a mother pushing a stroller passes him, he connects the dots and assumes that she dropped the baby. The woman is indignant and tells Chaplin to take the baby back when he puts it into the stroller with her own baby. He goes to put the baby back in the spot where he found it but a police officer catches him in the act. Chaplin flees the scene with the baby in his arms and catches a man walking when he turns the corner. He hands the baby over to him under the pretence of tying his shoes but then he promptly runs away, leaving the baby behind. In his quest to get rid of the baby, the man finds the stroller from Chaplin's previous encounter and puts the baby inside while the mother is nowhere to be found. In a fate of bad luck, Chaplin passes that very same stroller and the mother, who has now returned, assumes that Chaplin put the baby back inside. She drags him to the stroller and makes him take the baby back again with the help of the police officer. Chaplin, who considers throwing the baby into the sewer for a short moment, sits down and finds a letter between the cloth the baby is wrapped up in. The note begs the reader to “love and care for this orphan child”. Chaplin seems to be touched by this and the music transitions into a happier melody when he finally smiles at the baby. The video ends with Chaplin leaving the scene with the baby in his arms.

He then lits himself a cigarette only to find a baby lying next to the trashcan. The man checks if there is anyone around whom the baby maybe belong to but hes not able to spot anyone until a woman with a baggy comes down the alley. With her having still space left in the baggy, the man assumes that the baby might belong to her and puts it in the baggy. The woman then refuses to take the baby, probably claiming its not her own.   While the man tries to bring the baby back to the place he found it, a police officer walks by and spots him  so the man stops his doing and continues walking. When he sees a man walking with a sick, he ask if he could hold the baby for him so he can tie his shoes. Being freed he rans off and leaves the baby and hides in the alley. The man with the stick tries to find him but instead discovers the abandoned baggy and places the baby inside. Meanwhile the man has to leave his cover because the police office is walking in his direction. He passes the baggy just when the Woman returns to her babby and notices the second baby. The woman rans after him and hits him with an Umbrella, and gets him to go back to the baggy but the man refuses to take the baby. But the woman sees the police officer walking down the streets and tries to make notice of the argument going on between her and the man. The man immediately picks up the baby and leaves the scene. He then sits down on the curb thinking about pushing the baby down the gutter but he doesnt. He spots a note claiming that the person who finds the baby hopefully loves and takes care for the baby.After a while he walks down the same alleyway he came from  still holding the baby.		{'A': 1, 'man': 11, 'walks': 3, 'down': 6, 'an': 2, 'alleyway': 2, 'where': 1, 'garbage': 1, 'is': 3, 'thrown': 1, 'out': 1, 'of': 2, 'the': 42, 'windows': 1, 'and': 14, 'partly': 1, 'at': 1, 'him': 7, '.': 17, 'He': 4, 'then': 3, 'lits': 1, 'himself': 1, 'a': 9, 'cigarette': 1, 'only': 1, 'to': 15, 'find': 2, 'baby': 15, 'lying': 1, 'next': 1, 'trashcan': 1, 'The': 5, 'checks': 1, 'if': 2, 'there': 1, 'anyone': 2, 'around': 1, 'whom': 1, 'maybe': 1, 'belong': 2, 'but': 4, 'he': 10, 's': 1, 'not': 2, 'able': 1, 'spot': 1, 'until': 1, 'woman': 4, 'with': 4, 'baggy': 6, 'comes': 1, 'alley': 2, 'With': 1, 'her': 5, 'having': 1, 'still': 2, 'space': 1, 'left': 1, 'in': 4, ',': 5, 'assumes': 1, 'that': 2, 'might': 1, 'puts': 1, 'it': 2, 'refuses': 2, 'take': 2, 'probably': 1, 'claiming': 2, 'its': 1, 'own': 1, '  ': 1, 'While': 1, 'tries': 3, 'bring': 1, 'back': 2, 'place': 1, 'found': 1, 'police': 3, 'officer': 2, 'by': 1, 'spots': 2, ' ': 2, 'so': 2, 'stops': 1, 'his': 4, 'doing': 1, 'continues': 1, 'walking': 4, 'When': 1, 'sees': 2, 'sick': 1, 'ask': 1, 'could': 1, 'hold': 1, 'for': 2, 'can': 1, 'tie': 1, 'shoes': 1, 'Being': 1, 'freed': 1, 'rans': 2, 'off': 1, 'leaves': 2, 'hides': 1, 'stick': 1, 'instead': 1, 'discovers': 1, 'abandoned': 1, 'places': 1, 'inside': 1, 'Meanwhile': 1, 'has': 1, 'leave': 1, 'cover': 1, 'because': 1, 'office': 1, 'direction': 1, 'passes': 1, 'just': 1, 'when': 1, 'Woman': 1, 'returns': 1, 'babby': 1, 'notices': 1, 'second': 1, 'after': 1, 'hits': 1, 'Umbrella': 1, 'gets': 1, 'go': 1, 'But': 1, 'streets': 1, 'make': 1, 'notice': 1, 'argument': 1, 'going': 1, 'on': 2, 'between': 1, 'immediately': 1, 'picks': 1, 'up': 1, 'scene': 1, 'sits': 1, 'curb': 1, 'thinking': 1, 'about': 1, 'pushing': 1, 'gutter': 1, 'does': 1, 'nt': 1, 'note': 1, 'person': 1, 'who': 1, 'finds': 1, 'hopefully': 1, 'loves': 1, 'takes': 1, 'care': 1, 'After': 1, 'while': 1, 'same': 1, 'came': 1, 'from': 1, 'holding': 1}	{'DET': 59, 'NOUN': 67, 'VERB': 73, 'ADP': 37, 'SCONJ': 12, 'AUX': 6, 'CCONJ': 19, 'ADV': 19, 'PRON': 39, 'PUNCT': 22, 'PART': 12, 'ADJ': 5, 'SPACE': 3, 'PROPN': 2}

At the end of the narrow way, he finds a lonely baby lying on the floor, presuming at first that the child mighthave also been thrown out of the window. He picks up the kid and tries to figure out where it came from. At first, he possibly thinks that it belongs to a woman with another child in her pram, so he lays the baby into that pram, which leads to the angry woman shouting furiously at Chaplin. He then wants to lay the baby back to where he'd found it, but, being watched by a policeman, picks it up again and takes it with him onto the street where he then gives the baby to an old man. Chaplin escapes quickly and the old man again wants to get rid off the baby by putting it into the same woman's pram as before. The woman, again presuming that Chaplin laid it in there, runs after him and punches him on the head with an umbrella.

Chaplin	written_online	30.0	Outside classroom		Chaplin is a smoker, who can't seem to take care of himself and always ends up having thrown rubbish on himself. He is wearing a suit and a hat, carrying a walking stick. The second time a person dropped rubbish on Chaplin trough the window, he was angry and started coursing at this person saying: 'Awkward ass'. After this he lit up his cigarette and walked on. Suddenly, he found a crying baby so he picked it up and put it into the pram of a woman that just walked by saying to her: 'Pardon me, you dropped something.', which shows that he is being polite and slightly rude at the same time as he is assuming that the baby belongs to the woman. The woman complained so Chaplin took the baby again and put it back to where he found it. What he didn't realize was that he has been watched by a policeman so Chaplin had to take the baby into his arms again. When another man, who was older than Chaplin, passed by, Chaplin gave him the baby and ran away. This man put the baby back into the woman's pram which stood outside a store. When the woman came out of the store and discovered the second baby in her pram she was annoyed and started to get angry. Chaplin walked by her and she couldn't help herself but attacking him as well as showing him why she did so. The policeman walked by and the woman complained to him about Chaplin who ended up carrying the baby with him again. Sitting down in the edge of the sidewalk beside a drain, he was thinking about dropping the baby there but hesitated as it was most likely to be the child's death sentence. Then he found a letter in between the child's clothes, which he began to read. It said: 'Please love and care for this orphan child'. Chaplin put the piece of paper into his chestpocket and looked at the baby. In the end, he got up and walked away with the baby carried safely in his arms.

Suddenly bricks fell down on him from above, which turned his cigarette off. While lighting up a new cigarette, he discovers a baby beside a garbage can. He assumes that the baby belongs to a woman with a stroller, who walkes by in that moment. Consequently, he puts the baby inside the stroller but the woman gets angry and forces him to take the baby back. Afterwards, he tries to lay the baby back down beside the garbage can but a police officer happens to overlook the scene, forcing him to take the baby back into his arms. After noticing an elderly man walking by, he forcefully makes the man take the baby and walks away. The man coincidentelly discovers the same woman with the stroller from before and puts the baby into the stroller without the woman noticing. When Chaplin walks by again, the woman sees the baby in the stroller and angrily forces him to take the baby again under the watchfull eyes of the police officer. After shortly thinking about puting the baby into the drain channel, Chaplin gives up and discovers a letter inside the blanket in which the baby is wrapped up which notifies him that the baby is an orphan. Shortly after reading that Chaplin happily decides to keep the baby.		{'Charlie': 1, 'Chaplin': 4, 'is': 3, 'walking': 2, 'down': 3, 'the': 29, 'street': 1, 'while': 1, 'smoking': 1, 'a': 8, 'cigarette': 3, '.': 11, 'Suddenly': 1, 'bricks': 1, 'fell': 1, 'on': 1, 'him': 5, 'from': 2, 'above': 1, ',': 9, 'which': 3, 'turned': 1, 'his': 2, 'off': 1, 'While': 1, 'lighting': 1, 'up': 3, 'new': 1, 'he': 4, 'discovers': 3, 'baby': 14, 'beside': 2, 'garbage': 2, 'can': 2, 'He': 1, 'assumes': 1, 'that': 4, 'belongs': 1, 'to': 7, 'woman': 5, 'with': 2, 'stroller': 5, 'who': 1, 'walkes': 1, 'by': 3, 'in': 3, 'moment': 1, 'Consequently': 1, 'puts': 2, 'inside': 2, 'but': 2, 'gets': 1, 'angry': 1, 'and': 5, 'forces': 2, 'take': 4, 'back': 3, 'Afterwards': 1, 'tries': 1, 'lay': 1, 'police': 2, 'officer': 2, 'happens': 1, 'overlook': 1, 'scene': 1, 'forcing': 1, 'into': 3, 'arms': 1, 'After': 2, 'noticing': 2, 'an': 2, 'elderly': 1, 'man': 3, 'forcefully': 1, 'makes': 1, 'walks': 2, 'away': 1, 'The': 1, 'coincidentelly': 1, 'same': 1, 'before': 1, 'without': 1, 'When': 1, 'again': 2, 'sees': 1, 'angrily': 1, 'under': 1, 'watchfull': 1, 'eyes': 1, 'of': 1, 'shortly': 1, 'thinking': 1, 'about': 1, 'puting': 1, 'drain': 1, 'channel': 1, 'gives': 1, 'letter': 1, 'blanket': 1, 'wrapped': 1, 'notifies': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'Shortly': 1, 'after': 1, 'reading': 1, 'happily': 1, 'decides': 1, 'keep': 1}	{'PROPN': 5, 'AUX': 4, 'VERB': 39, 'ADP': 32, 'DET': 41, 'NOUN': 49, 'SCONJ': 6, 'PUNCT': 20, 'ADV': 18, 'PRON': 16, 'ADJ': 5, 'CCONJ': 7, 'PART': 6}

The obviously poverty stricken neighborhood is heavily littered and people have no shame throwing trash out of their windows. Mr. Chaplin is repeatedly hit by named trash. After his cigar is lost in one of the incidents, he stops to light a cigarette. It is at this moment that he realizes an infant laying on the ground. He picks the baby up and puts it in a stroller of a passerby. The Lady calls him out and Mr. Chaplin again has to take possession of the little one. He thinks about putting the baby back where he found it but is stopped by a police officer. In an attempt to ditch the infant he asks an older gentleman to hold the baby so he can tie his shoes. Mr. Chaplin takes advantage of the situation and runs away. The older gentleman then decides to put the infant in the stroller of the Lady who previously had called out Mr. Chaplin. The Lady who had parked the stroller in front of a store comes back out and sees Mr. Chaplin, who coincidentally happened to walk past store and hits him with an umbrella. And again, Mr. Chaplin has to take possession of the baby. Desperate and out of options Mr. Chaplin sits down holding the baby in his arms. He finds a note hidden in the babies clothing. The note says that the baby is an orphan who needs to be loved. Mr. Chaplin immediately falls in live with the little bugger and walks away happily.		{'A': 1, 'man': 1, ',': 6, 'Mr.': 9, 'Charly': 1, 'Chaplin': 9, 'is': 7, 'strolling': 1, 'down': 2, 'a': 8, 'street': 1, 'in': 8, 'building': 1, 'side': 1, 'from': 1, 'the': 18, 'industrial': 1, 'era': 1, '.': 17, 'The': 5, 'obviously': 1, 'poverty': 1, 'stricken': 1, 'neighborhood': 1, 'heavily': 1, 'littered': 1, 'and': 8, 'people': 1, 'have': 1, 'no': 1, 'shame': 1, 'throwing': 1, 'trash': 2, 'out': 5, 'of': 9, 'their': 1, 'windows': 1, 'repeatedly': 1, 'hit': 1, 'by': 2, 'named': 1, 'After': 1, 'his': 3, 'cigar': 1, 'lost': 1, 'one': 2, 'incidents': 1, 'he': 5, 'stops': 1, 'to': 8, 'light': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'It': 1, 'at': 1, 'this': 1, 'moment': 1, 'that': 2, 'realizes': 1, 'an': 5, 'infant': 3, 'laying': 1, 'on': 1, 'ground': 1, 'He': 3, 'picks': 1, 'baby': 6, 'up': 1, 'puts': 1, 'it': 2, 'stroller': 3, 'passerby': 1, 'Lady': 3, 'calls': 1, 'him': 2, 'again': 2, 'has': 2, 'take': 2, 'possession': 2, 'little': 2, 'thinks': 1, 'about': 1, 'putting': 1, 'back': 2, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'but': 1, 'stopped': 1, 'police': 1, 'officer': 1, 'In': 1, 'attempt': 1, 'ditch': 1, 'asks': 1, 'older': 2, 'gentleman': 2, 'hold': 1, 'so': 1, 'can': 1, 'tie': 1, 'shoes': 1, 'takes': 1, 'advantage': 1, 'situation': 1, 'runs': 1, 'away': 2, 'then': 1, 'decides': 1, 'put': 1, 'who': 4, 'previously': 1, 'had': 2, 'called': 1, 'parked': 1, 'front': 1, 'store': 2, 'comes': 1, 'sees': 1, 'coincidentally': 1, 'happened': 1, 'walk': 1, 'past': 1, 'hits': 1, 'with': 2, 'umbrella': 1, 'And': 1, 'Desperate': 1, 'options': 1, 'sits': 1, 'holding': 1, 'arms': 1, 'finds': 1, 'note': 2, 'hidden': 1, 'babies': 1, 'clothing': 1, 'says': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'needs': 1, 'be': 1, 'loved': 1, 'immediately': 1, 'falls': 1, 'live': 1, 'bugger': 1, 'walks': 1, 'happily': 1}	{'DET': 39, 'NOUN': 52, 'PUNCT': 23, 'PROPN': 22, 'AUX': 11, 'VERB': 47, 'ADP': 33, 'ADJ': 7, 'ADV': 16, 'CCONJ': 10, 'PRON': 21, 'SCONJ': 5, 'NUM': 2, 'PART': 8}

The residents throw their rubbish out of the window and onto the street, hitting the strolling man in the process. The man loses his cigarette as a results and decides to fetch another one from his cigarette box and light it. At that moment he notices a baby, wrapped in cloth, lying on the pavement next to a bin. He picks it up and looks for the rightful owner. He sees a woman with a buggy passing by and decides to approach her. The man puts the baby in her buggy and tells her that she dropped something. Upon her infuriated reaction he takes the baby from the pram and puts it back on the pavement, where he found it earlier on. A police officer catches him in the act and the man picks the baby up again to avoid any trouble. On his now continued search for the respective parent he spots an old man with a long beard. The man walks up to the bearded pedestrian and asks him to hold the baby, so that he can tie his shoes. The old man takes the baby and our main character makes a quick getaway and hides. The bearded man chases after him but cannot catch up. He sees a buggy without an owner and inconspicuously lays the baby in it. The main character comes out of hiding and continues his way. Coincidentally he walks past that buggy at the same time the woman owning the buggy comes out of a building and notices the baby that does not belong to her. She sees the men from the beginning and concludes that he must have put it in the pram again. She chases after him and hits him with the umbrella she was carrying. They both argue with each other when the police officer from the beginning walks past them and notices the fuss. Just like earlier the man takes the baby to avoid any further conflict. He gives up his search and sits down on the pavement. He looks at a manhole next to, opens it, looks at the child and shortly considers throwing the child away.

can be uh which we can see because of his iconic hat and uh walking stick and his suit and uh the clip shows how Charlie Chaplin / finds a baby when he's lighting his cigarette like standing in an alleyway and uh in the movie club it's shown how he tries to get rid of the baby in a comical way for example in the beginning he starts uh walking towards a carriage that has a baby in it and then uh tells the mother presumably the mother th= the woman standing next to the carriage that she has dropped something and he's indicating to the baby he has found uh and she / reacts in a very hhh in a very / mad way and uh starts shouting at him so then he has to take the baby back so ‘n’ then he decides decides to just put the baby back uh on the ground where he found it when a police officer comes coming by is coming by and uh sees it and presumably thinks that he is trying to get rid of his own baby so uh Charlie Chaplin has to take the baby uh in his arms again and uh in the next situation a very old man uh walking with a walking crane is shown and uh Charlie indicates that he has to uh he's holding the baby in his arms and he indicates that he has to fix his shoelaces so he gives the baby to the old man for him to hold it and uh after he gave the baby after he gives the baby to the man he runs off so the old man because he can't walk properly uh can't follow him quickly enough so that uh when he turns around a corner he sees a carriage ‘n’ he puts the baby in there to get rid of it uh and the carriage was standing or is standing in front of a shop and there's no uh adult beneath it uh besides it but in the next uh scene we can see that the woman that it's the woman that Charlie Chaplin has met before so uh when Charlie in the next scene is walking uh past the carriage the woman recognizes him and sees a baby in her carriage and uh thinks that he has dropped the baby again like uh the foreign baby into her baby's carriage and she starts shouting and screaming and hitting him hhh violently uh so the police officer that has seen Charlie Chaplin trying to get rid of the baby uh sees all this and it caused cau= caught his eye so he goes in uh to the scene to try to understand what is happening and the woman explains it so Charlie e= explains the situation to him so ‘n’ then Charlie has no other uh op= no other way out than taking the baby and the last scene is him sitting down on like uh on the street with the baby in his hand and underneath him he sees a uh / like a / street xxx a canalization uh / lid and uh he opens it and indicates to throw the baby into the canalization but then after taking a look at the baby's face he decides against it and uh he takes it into his arm / and wants to go off and then he finds a letter uh attached to the baby ‘n’ that says that the baby wants or needs to be loved		"{'the': 46, 'movie': 2, 'clip': 2, 'shown': 3, 'to': 23, 'me': 1, 'showed': 1, 'uh': 39, 'a': 21, 'black': 1, 'and': 31, 'white':

He stops and opens a little box that seems to contain half-smocked cigares and cigarettes. In the following, the man uses a match to lighten a cigar, before starting to smoke it. All of his gestures are exaggerated, which adds to the all in all comedic feeling of the video.  <br/> Suddenly, he turns around and finds an infant, who is swaddled in a blanket beneath a trashcan. The man picks the baby up and looks around and up into the sky, seemingly wondering where the baby came from. He sees a woman with a baby in a stroller passing by and places the found infant in her stroller, telling her that she has dropped something. Meanwhile, the woman, starts shouting  and arguing. Devastated, the man takes the baby out of the stroller and the now angry woman walks of with her child. <br/> In the next scene, the man tries to lay the baby down next to the trashcan, where he has found it earlier, when a police officer passes by and sees it. Probably thinking the man just tries to get rid of his baby, he scolds him. The man leaves quickly with the baby.  <br/> In the following scene the man finds an old man, walking slowly with the help of a walking cane. He gestures at the eldery man to hold the baby, while he acts as if he is tying his shoe laces, before quickly running off.  <br/> The man, followed by the eldery man,  runs away and finally hides in a big container. The eldery man cannot find him and is left with the baby, until he sees another baby in a stroller in front of a store. He quickly drops of the baby and walks away. In this moment, the police officer is passing by.  <br/> When a woman exits the store it is visible that it is the same woman that appeared earlier in the clip. She sees the young man passing by and starts attacking him, thinking that he placed the baby into her stroller again.  <br/> The police officer notices the argument and stops by. After the women explained the situation the young man quickly picks up the baby again.  <br/>  <br/> Finally, he sits down with the baby in his arms. Underneath him, there is an utility hole. He debates throwing the baby away, when suddenly he finds a note in the baby's swaddle. The note says ""Please love and care for this orphan child"".  <br/>  <br/> In the last scene the man looks at the baby and stands up, finally accepting his fate."

It is a movie without any spoken language but background music is playing the entire time. The main character - the man - walks along an alley and finds a baby next to a trash can. He picks the baby up and sees a women near by. He assumes the baby is hers therefore he wants to bring it back to her. The mother dosen't want the baby, it's probably not hers, so the man decided to put it back where he found it. As he puts the baby to the ground a police man appears and tells him off. The man takes the baby and looks around to find its parents. He is not successful thus he tricks another man into taking the baby. The other man does not want to keep the baby either, though, so he puts the baby in a woman's trolly. It was the same woman as the one the main character met earlier. She finds the baby in her trolly as the main character walks by her so she makes him take back the baby.

On the left, next to a trashcan, he sees an infant and picks it up. In this moment, a woman with a stroller walks into frame and down the opposite side of the alley. The man notices her, follows her and tried to get her attention. When woman stops, the man places the infant inside of the stroller and talks to her. Apparently the infant does not belong to the woman, because she rejects it and returns it to the man. After that the man walks back the spot where he found the infant and lays it down. Just in that moment a police officer appears in the frame. The man notices the police officer and picks the infant back up and walks away. In the next shot, we see the man walking down a street and meeting another man. The first man gives the infant to the second man and runs away. The second man tries to pursue the first man, who at this point is hiding in a shack. When the second man fails to find the first man, he notices a stroller on the side of the street and lays the infant down in the stroller. After that, he runs away. In the next shot, the first man leaves the shack and meets the police officer once again and walks away. In another shot, a woman appears in the frame next to the stroller and sees the infant. In this moment the first man walks past her and she pursues him and knocks him down with an umbrella. She keeps hitting the man with the umbrella and forces him back to the stroller, where they start arguing. In the next shot, the police officer appears again and walks towards the man and the woman. After a short period of time, the man picks up the infant and walks away. After a while, the man stops and sits down on the sidewalk. While he is sitting there, he thinks about dropping the infant into a gutter, he quickly abandons that thought. In the next moment, he attempts to pet the infant, but the infant bites him. In the next moment, the man inspects the infant clothing and notices a note. The note reads ""Please liv and care for this orphew [sic!] child"". After reading the note, the man pets the infant again and walks away."

Chaplin	written_online	20.0	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (German/English)	The story is placed in a city-like scene. Chaplin is walking through the streets and tries to avoid the garbage that is thrown out of the windows. After he was showered with old vegetables from a window above, he wants to smoke a cigarette but a baby that is lying behind a garbage bin is stopping him. He searches for the mother and thinks that a woman with a baby stroller is the mother but soon he finds out that she’s not because she starts to argue with him, as soon as he places the infant into her carrier. Chaplin wants to put the baby back next to the garbage bin but a police officer catches him and he has to stick to the child. After that he  gives the baby to an old man pretending his shoelaces are open and running away. The old man places the baby into the baby carrier of the woman, who is not the mother, after chasing after Chaplin. Chaplin is caught by the same woman and they argue until she calls the police officer and Chaplin takes the baby back. Desperate, he sits on the road curb and thinks about dumping the baby into the sewer but he finds a letter attached to the baby, which says that the finder should care for this orphan baby. Chaplin seems touched by this and takes the baby with him.		{'The': 2, 'story': 1, 'is': 8, 'placed': 1, 'in': 1, 'a': 9, 'city': 1, '-': 1, 'like': 1, 'scene': 1, '.': 10, 'Chaplin': 6, 'walking': 1, 'through': 1, 'the': 23, 'streets': 1, 'and': 8, 'tries': 1, 'to': 9, 'avoid': 1, 'garbage': 3, 'that': 6, 'thrown': 1, 'out': 2, 'of': 2, 'windows': 1, 'After': 2, 'he': 8, 'was': 1, 'showered': 1, 'with': 4, 'old': 3, 'vegetables': 1, 'from': 1, 'window': 1, 'above': 1, ',': 6, 'wants': 2, 'smoke': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'but': 4, 'baby': 11, 'lying': 1, 'behind': 1, 'bin': 2, 'stopping': 1, 'him': 4, 'He': 1, 'searches': 1, 'for': 2, 'mother': 3, 'thinks': 2, 'woman': 3, 'stroller': 1, 'soon': 2, 'finds': 2, 'she': 3, '’s': 1, 'not': 2, 'because': 1, 'starts': 1, 'argue': 2, 'as': 2, 'places': 2, 'infant': 1, 'into': 3, 'her': 1, 'carrier': 2, 'put': 1, 'back': 2, 'next': 1, 'police': 2, 'officer': 2, 'catches': 1, 'has': 1, 'stick': 1, 'child': 1, ' ': 1, 'gives': 1, 'an': 1, 'man': 2, 'pretending': 1, 'his': 1, 'shoelaces': 1, 'are': 1, 'open': 1, 'running': 1, 'away': 1, 'who': 1, 'after': 2, 'chasing': 1, 'caught': 1, 'by': 2, 'same': 1, 'they': 1, 'until': 1, 'calls': 1, 'takes': 2, 'Desperate': 1, 'sits': 1, 'on': 1, 'road': 1, 'curb': 1, 'about': 1, 'dumping': 1, 'sewer': 1, 'letter': 1, 'attached': 1, 'which': 1, 'says': 1, 'finder': 1, 'should': 1, 'care': 1, 'this': 2, 'orphan': 1, 'seems': 1, 'touched': 1}	{'DET': 36, 'NOUN': 47, 'AUX': 11, 'VERB': 41, 'ADP': 28, 'PUNCT': 17, 'ADJ': 7, 'PROPN': 7, 'CCONJ': 12, 'PART': 7, 'PRON': 25, 'SCONJ': 7, 'ADV': 8, 'SPACE': 1}

She realizes his action and hands him back the baby. Subsequently Chaplin puts back the baby where he found it but is observed by a police officer. Realizing he cannot leave the baby there he takes it and walks the streets carrying it in his arms. He then asks a man to hold the baby for a minute so he can tie his shoe. After the man took the child from him, Chaplin runs away and hides. The man tries to find him but fails. Thus, he places the baby in the buggy of the same lady Chaplin placed it in before. The lady discovers the child at the exact same moment Chaplin, who came out of his hideout, walks by. She recognizes him and hits him with her umbrella and makes him pick up the baby with help of the police officer. Chaplin then sits down on the curb and thinks about throwing the baby in the drain.

He picks up the baby, wanting to go looking for its parent, when a woman with a baby stroller comes walking by. Chaplin catches up to the stroller, but the woman has temporarily left. He places the baby inside, when suddenly the woman emerges again, claiming it is not her baby and he should take it back. The woman walks away and Chaplin returns to the point where he originally found the small child. He places the baby back on the ground, when a police man appears behind him, observing this. Immediately, Chaplin takes the baby and walks off. He comes upon an old man, with a walking stick. Under the pretense that Chaplin has to tie his shoelaces, he gives the man the baby. Instead of taking it back, Chaplin runs away. He hides from the old man. The old man comes looking for him and finds a baby stroller. Here he puts the baby and walks away. Chaplin emerges from his hideout. He walks by the baby stroller and is spotted by the woman, who, upon realizing the baby is once again in her stroller, proceeds to beat Chaplin with her umbrella. The police man notices the two arguing and approaches. Chaplin once again decides to pick up the baby. He walks away and sits down on the side of the road. For a split second, he considers dropping the baby down the drain, but does not. He finds a bit of paper underneath the child's clothes. It reads ""Please love and care for this orphan child."" Chaplin's attitude changes, and with joy in his step, he walks off, together with the baby in his arms."

The man is hit by a few pieces of the material albeit the most part of it misses him. However, a few meters below the alley, the protagonist encounters a similar situation in that someone throws waste out of a window which eventually hits him directly and causes him to stop. After removing the remaining waste from his suit and lighting a cigarette, the man discovers a crying baby inside a bundle of blankets next to a trash can. This discovery astonishes the protagonist: He looks around in an effort to determine the source of baby.  <br/> In the same moment, a woman with a pushchair enters the scene - she pushes her pushchair up the street the man just came down. The man discovers the pushchair and concludes that the woman must have dropped the baby. He thus carries the baby over to the the pushchair in order to bed the child into the pushchair. His deed, however, infuriates the woman as she denies to have dropped the baby. As result, the protagonist takes again the baby into his arms an walks back to place the baby next to the crash can where he originally discovered the baby.  <br/> Unfortunately, this situation is observed by a police man which just entered the scene. Afraid of the police officer, the protagonist takes the baby into his arm again and walks away. In a neighbouring street, the protagonist asks an old man to hold the baby for a few seconds as he pretends he has to tie his shoes. Instead of tying his shoes, however, he flees the scene and hides behind a door. The old man tries to pursue the protagonist but is to slow. However, he discovers the same pushchair the protagonist has discovered earlier and beds the baby in it.  <br/> When the woman returns to her pushchair, she observes immediately that the baby was placed again inside her pushchair. In the same moment, the protagonist passes her: She follows him and beats him down with her umbrella. The woman forces him to return to the pushchair and demands the removal of the additional child in it. The two discussing parties are joined by the police officer which eventually results in the man carrying the baby away. After a few meters, he sits down on the kerbstone. The protagonist briefly considers to throw the baby into a gully, but discards this option. The baby is then closer scrutinised by the protagonist. His examination reveals a note: ""Please love and care for this orphan child'. Finally, the protagonist seems to adopt the child and walks out of the scene."

The mother however does not know the baby and does not accept it. The man seems confused and tries to get rid of the child. He tricks another man into holding it and walks away. Said man sees the stroller of the mother who is in a shop and puts the baby there. When the woman leaves the shop and realizes that a strange baby lies in her stroller.

As he stops to light a cigarette he finds a baby. While inspecting the child he sees a woman with a baby carriage looking for something. He assumes that the child is her's and puts it in her stroller. But the woman is not the mother of the child so he takes the baby out again and puts it back in the spot where he found it. But an officer observes this and tells him to not leave his baby there. As he walks on with the baby he asks a stranger to hold it pretending to tie his laces and running away. The stranger sees the mother with her baby carriage and places the child in it again. As Charles Chaplin accidently walks by the mother assumes he did it again and knocks him down with her umbrella. As the officer arrives to see what the matter is, Charles is forced to take the baby with him again. He sits down on the sidewalk thinking what to do with the baby as he finds a note. It says to love and take care of the orphant which he does by taking the child home.

He tries to give the kid to a woman with a stroller to look after it but the woman refuses to take the baby because she already takes care of her own. Chaplin, who also does not intend to take on the responsibility of taking care of the child, tries to place it next to the garbage bins again. At this moment a police man appears, who believes it is Chaplins child and he is the one who is comitting the crime of leaving it on the streets. Chaplin grabs the child and takes it with him and away from the police man. On his way he passes an old man with a crutch, hands him the baby and runs off. The old man ,however,  also tries to get rid of the baby and places it in the same womans stroller as Chaplin tried to place it before. The old man exits the scene and the woman notices the ""extra"" baby in her stroller right as Chaplin walkes by her unknowingly. She runs after him and urges him to take the baby back, Chaplin is refusing but when the police man enters the scene he takes the baby and runs.He sits down on the curbstone and tries to think of a way to get rid of the child, when he suddenly finds a note. The note states that the child is orphened and in desperate need of someone to love and take care of it. Chaplin smiles and holdes the baby closer, it appears as if he wants to keep and take care of the child."

He seems annoyed and lights a cigarette. When smoking, he discovers that an infant baby is lying on the ground near him. He picks it up and tries to sneak it into the buggy of a woman that is walking by him. She spots his attempt and tells him that he dropped something, so he takes the baby again. Chaplin then tries to put it back at the place where he found the baby, but a policemen witnesses him doing so, which leads to Chaplin picking up the baby again. Afterwards he tricks an old man into holding the baby and runs away. The old man then puts the baby into the buggy of the woman that walked by Chaplin earlier on. She discovers the infant in her buggy while Chaplin is strolling by and beats Chaplin up with her umbrella. He then takes the baby again and sits down with it by the sidewalk. He finds a letter inside the blanket of the baby which says that it is an orphan child. After understanding the situation of the baby he smiles at it and walks away while holding it in his arms.		{'In': 1, 'this': 1, 'short': 1, 'movie': 1, 'Charlie': 1, 'Chaplin': 6, 'walks': 2, 'along': 1, 'a': 5, 'street': 1, 'when': 1, 'suddenly': 1, 'garbage': 1, 'is': 5, 'thrown': 1, 'next': 1, 'to': 4, 'him': 5, 'from': 1, 'an': 4, 'upper': 1, 'window': 1, '.': 12, 'He': 4, 'seems': 1, 'annoyed': 1, 'and': 7, 'lights': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'When': 1, 'smoking': 1, ',': 4, 'he': 6, 'discovers': 2, 'that': 5, 'infant': 2, 'baby': 9, 'lying': 1, 'on': 2, 'the': 17, 'ground': 1, 'near': 1, 'picks': 1, 'it': 7, 'up': 3, 'tries': 2, 'sneak': 1, 'into': 3, 'buggy': 3, 'of': 4, 'woman': 2, 'walking': 1, 'by': 4, 'She': 2, 'spots': 1, 'his': 2, 'attempt': 1, 'tells': 1, 'dropped': 1, 'something': 1, 'so': 2, 'takes': 2, 'again': 3, 'then': 3, 'put': 1, 'back': 1, 'at': 2, 'place': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'but': 1, 'policemen': 1, 'witnesses': 1, 'doing': 1, 'which': 2, 'leads': 1, 'picking': 1, 'Afterwards': 1, 'tricks': 1, 'old': 2, 'man': 2, 'holding': 2, 'runs': 1, 'away': 2, 'The': 1, 'puts': 1, 'walked': 1, 'earlier': 1, 'in': 2, 'her': 2, 'while': 2, 'strolling': 1, 'beats': 1, 'with': 2, 'umbrella': 1, 'sits': 1, 'down': 1, 'sidewalk': 1, 'finds': 1, 'letter': 1, 'inside': 1, 'blanket': 1, 'says': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'child': 1, 'After': 1, 'understanding': 1, 'situation': 1, 'smiles': 1, 'arms': 1}	{'ADP': 30, 'DET': 28, 'ADJ': 6, 'NOUN': 34, 'PROPN': 7, 'VERB': 38, 'SCONJ': 8, 'ADV': 16, 'AUX': 5, 'PRON': 33, 'PUNCT': 16, 'CCONJ': 8, 'PART': 2}

In a corner, Charlie finds an abandoned child. When he sees a woman passing by pushing a pushchair, he concludes that she propably lost the baby or at least will know what to do with it. He calls her and puts the baby into the pushchair, but the woman protests and explains that he misinterpreted something. Charlie leaves with the child in his arms. Leaving it in the corner where he found it turns out to be a bad idea, as a policeman approaches and signals him to take care of the baby. Then an elderly man passes by. Charlie asks him to hold the child for him, pretending to lace his shoes. Instead, he runs away and hides. The elderly man notices the pushchair parked outside of a shop and leaves the baby there. In the meantime, Charlie leaves his hiding place. The approaching policeman blocks his way, so he turns and walks in the direction of the shop. Having passed by the pushchair, he gets stopped by the woman who left the shop and sees the baby in her pushchair. The starting dispute calls the policeman's attention. Charlie ends up with the baby in his arms. Desperate, he sits down, consideres shortly disposing of the baby in the gutters. Having a closer look at this unwanted bundle, he discoveres a piece of paper slipped into the clothes of the baby. It is a little letter, asking to love and to take care of the orphan. This warms Charlie's heart, and he finally accepts the baby as his responsability.

Construction workers throw their rubble carelessly out of the windows, hitting Charlie with it, who loses his cigar. After he has lit another cigaret, he notices a newborn, laying on the ground, next to some rubbish. He picks it up and looks around, trying to figure out where it came from or who it might belong to. A woman with a pram appears. While she leaves it unsupervised for a moment, Charlie puts the baby in it, thinking he has found the mother. The woman, however, notices him and is scandalized, for this child is not hers. Charlie quickly takes the baby, and walks back to the spot where he has found it. His plan, to put the newborn back to where he found it, fails, as a police officer walks by and sees him. Charlie quickly walks away and fools an elderly man to think, he needs to tie his shoe, and gives him the baby. He then runs away. The man is not as fast as him, for he limps, and loses Charlie out of sight. He passes the pram of the woman, though, and puts the baby in it. When the woman returns to her pram, finding the child in it again, Charlie happens to pass by. Of course, she thinks that he left the baby there, again. As furious as she is, she runs after him, beats him with her umbrella, and drags him back to the pram. Charlie wants to explain himself, but the officer notices them, and so, Charlie takes the baby. He sits down on the curb and finds a piece of paper in the baby's clothes. Learning that it is an orphan and needs someone to love and take care of it, he holds it close to him and decides that he will not abandon it.

Chaplin	written_online	30.0	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (German/English)	The story begins with the male protagonist walking down a street with a cane , smoking a cigarette. While he strolls down the street he is hit by a load of clutter/ rubbish someone throws out of a window onto the street. Even though the man seems surprised at first, it does not take him long to recover. He just pulls out a box, to light himself another cigarette and continues walking. Only a few seconds later he suddenly stumbles upon a crying baby lying on the ground and picks it up. The man looks and around and notices a woman pushing a baby carriage down the street. When she enters a building the man quickly rushes to the carriage and places the baby in it. Unfortunately he is caught by the woman who starts to argue with him and refuses to take the child. Thus the man picks up the baby again only to return it to the place where he found it. But he is caught again, this time by a police officer. After that the man tries to get rid of the baby by placing it in the arms of an old man under false pretenses. He then quickly runs away. The old man also notices the baby carriage standing on the sidewalk, no parents in sight. He decides to leave the baby in it as well and walks off uncaught. Only a few seconds later the woman steps out onto the street in the exact same moment the protagonist walks by the carriage.

As he sees a woman with a newborn walking by, the man assumes that the baby must be hers. However his assumption turns out to be wrong and he and the baby are sent away by the woman. After being caught in the process of leaving the child, where he found it, the main character tries to get rid of the baby one more time, by tricking a man into holding the baby and then proceeding to run away. But the main character ends up with the baby once again due to said man leaving it with the aforementioned women, who hands it back to him. When he finds out that the baby is an orphan he finally decides to accept his faith and keep the baby.		{'This': 1, 'clip': 1, 'from': 1, 'the': 15, 'silent': 1, 'film': 1, '“': 2, 'The': 2, 'kid': 1, 'by': 4, 'Charlie': 2, 'Chaplin': 1, 'and': 7, 'starring': 1, 'Chapman': 1, ',': 6, 'was': 1, 'released': 1, 'in': 2, '1921': 1, 'focuses': 1, 'on': 1, 'a': 5, 'man': 4, 'who': 2, 'happens': 2, 'to': 10, 'find': 1, 'baby': 10, 'has': 1, 'figure': 1, 'out': 3, 'what': 1, 'do': 1, 'with': 4, 'said': 2, '.': 7, ' ': 1, '<': 1, 'br/': 1, '>': 1, 'main': 3, 'character': 3, 'come': 1, 'across': 1, 'an': 2, 'abandoned': 1, 'As': 1, 'he': 5, 'sees': 1, 'woman': 2, 'newborn': 1, 'walking': 1, 'assumes': 1, 'that': 2, 'must': 1, 'be': 2, 'hers': 1, 'However': 1, 'his': 2, 'assumption': 1, 'turns': 1, 'wrong': 1, 'are': 1, 'sent': 1, 'away': 2, 'After': 1, 'being': 1, 'caught': 1, 'process': 1, 'of': 2, 'leaving': 2, 'child': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'it': 3, 'tries': 1, 'get': 1, 'rid': 1, 'one': 1, 'more': 1, 'time': 1, 'tricking': 1, 'into': 1, 'holding': 1, 'then': 1, 'proceeding': 1, 'run': 1, 'But': 1, 'ends': 1, 'up': 1, 'once': 1, 'again': 1, 'due': 1, 'aforementioned': 1, 'women': 1, 'hands': 1, 'back': 1, 'him': 1, 'When': 1, 'finds': 1, 'is': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'finally': 1, 'decides': 1, 'accept': 1, 'faith': 1, 'keep': 1}	{'DET': 25, 'NOUN': 30, 'ADP': 22, 'ADJ': 10, 'PUNCT': 15, 'PROPN': 5, 'CCONJ': 8, 'VERB': 32, 'AUX': 8, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 15, 'PART': 9, 'SPACE': 1, 'X': 2, 'SCONJ': 5, 'ADV': 8}

As he smokes a cig he discovers a baby lying on the ground beneath the trash cans, wrapped in rags. Assuming that its parents forgot it there, he starts to search for them. When a woman with a baby carriage walks by, he puts the findling in the carriage, but the woman gets worked up because it is not hers. Chaplin decides to put it back where he found it, but then an officer notices him, thinking that Chaplin is about to abandon his child. As that would turn him into a bad person, he has to find another place for the child. An old man is his next victim, he palms it off on him. The old man then again tracks down the same carriage and Chaplin, walking by finally free from the burden, is being made responsible as the woman recognizes him as she returns to the scene. Unfortunately, the officer is back again, so he needs to take back the baby. Pondering on the curb, he finds a note in the bundle, saying that the founder should take care of the orphan. Chaplin seems at peace with this wish and will do as he has been told.		{'Charlie': 1, 'Chaplin': 5, 'takes': 1, 'a': 8, 'walk': 1, 'in': 4, 'suburb': 1, '.': 11, 'As': 2, 'he': 10, 'smokes': 1, 'cig': 1, 'discovers': 1, 'baby': 3, 'lying': 1, 'on': 3, 'the': 16, 'ground': 1, 'beneath': 1, 'trash': 1, 'cans': 1, ',': 14, 'wrapped': 1, 'rags': 1, 'Assuming': 1, 'that': 4, 'its': 1, 'parents': 1, 'forgot': 1, 'it': 5, 'there': 1, 'starts': 1, 'to': 6, 'search': 1, 'for': 2, 'them': 1, 'When': 1, 'woman': 3, 'with': 2, 'carriage': 3, 'walks': 1, 'by': 2, 'puts': 1, 'findling': 1, 'but': 2, 'gets': 1, 'worked': 1, 'up': 1, 'because': 1, 'is': 5, 'not': 1, 'hers': 1, 'decides': 1, 'put': 1, 'back': 3, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'then': 2, 'an': 1, 'officer': 2, 'notices': 1, 'him': 4, 'thinking': 1, 'about': 1, 'abandon': 1, 'his': 2, 'child': 2, 'would': 1, 'turn': 1, 'into': 1, 'bad': 1, 'person': 1, 'has': 2, 'find': 1, 'another': 1, 'place': 1, 'An': 1, 'old': 2, 'man': 2, 'next': 1, 'victim': 1, 'palms': 1, 'off': 1, 'The': 1, 'again': 2, 'tracks': 1, 'down': 1, 'same': 1, 'and': 2, 'walking': 1, 'finally': 1, 'free': 1, 'from': 1, 'burden': 1, 'being': 1, 'made': 1, 'responsible': 1, 'as': 3, 'recognizes': 1, 'she': 1, 'returns': 1, 'scene': 1, 'Unfortunately': 1, 'so': 1, 'needs': 1, 'take': 2, 'Pondering': 1, 'curb': 1, 'finds': 1, 'note': 1, 'bundle': 1, 'saying': 1, 'founder': 1, 'should': 1, 'care': 1, 'of': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'seems': 1, 'at': 1, 'peace': 1, 'this': 1, 'wish': 1, 'will': 1, 'do': 1, 'been': 1, 'told': 1}	{'PROPN': 6, 'VERB': 36, 'DET': 29, 'NOUN': 38, 'ADP': 22, 'PUNCT': 25, 'SCONJ': 11, 'PRON': 25, 'ADV': 11, 'PART': 6, 'CCONJ': 4, 'AUX': 12, 'ADJ': 8}

He picks it up and tries to find out where it came from. A woman with a buggy then passes him and Chaplin thinks the newborn belongs to her. He tries to give it to her but she refuses. After that, he brings the baby back to the place in which he found it but he gets stopped by a police officer who witnesses Chaplin dropping the child next to the trash. He then tries to get rid of the baby by tricking an old man and running away, but that also fails, again because of the lady with the buggy. Exhausted, Chaplin sits on the curb and finds a letter which the newborn was carrying around. The letter gives Chaplin the information that the newborn is an orphan.

From an around four meter high window someone throws out his trash which nearly hits Chaplin. After hesitating for just a second, Chaplin proceeds on his way until he is hit by trash from another window further down the alleyway which knocks a cigarette out of his mouth. The text ""Awkward ass"" appears on the screen, as Chaplin looks above him and shortly after he searches his cigarette case for a new one. Chaplin pulls one out, sticks it in his mouth and then pulls out a match which he lights on his shoe. After taking the first hit of his cigarette, Chaplin notices a newborn to his left next to whats looks like a trashcan of some sort. He then inspects it for a couple of seconds and takes a look around him before picking the newborn up. A lady with a stroller walks past him and he shouts after her, before laying the baby into the stroller. Another text pops up, saying: ""Pardon me, you dropped something"". Chaplin points at the baby as he walks away but the lady insists that the baby is not hers. After picking up the wrong child at first, Chaplin is corrected by the lady and picks up the baby he found earlier and leaves the now certainly angry lady. He returns the baby to the place he found it, not noticing the police officer standing behind him. Chaplin then turns around, notices the police officer and quickly picks the baby up again, walking around the corner where a man with visible physical problems walks down the street. The man is handed the baby by Chaplin under the excuse of tieing his shoelaces, before he quickly runs away. The old man tries to chase Chaplin, who quickly hid behind a corner. After a few seconds, the old man finds the same stroller Chaplin found before and lays the baby inside it. When coming out of his hiding place, Chaplin runs into the police officer and quickly turns around, running directly to the lady with the stroller. After ignoring her, she chases him and knocks him to the ground with an umbrella. She grabs him by his jacket and pulls him right back to her stroller, and after a few seconds of arguing over the baby the police officer joins them. Chaplin then picks the baby up again, drops his walking stick and sits down on the sidewalk. He then opens an manhole and thinks about dropping the baby inside it, but quickly comes to the decision not to do it. Shortly after, Chaplin finds a note in the sheets the baby is covered in, which says:""Please love and care for this orphan child"". Afterwards, he inspects and plays with the child for a brief moment, before standing up happily and taking the child with him."

Each attempt to get rid of the baby fails, even leaving it in the place he found it, since an officer caught him doing so.

Whilst he is having a smoke break he finds an infant abandoned next to him. He presumes that the child must come from a mother that's passing by and pushing around a large trolly with another infant. It turns out that the infant is not hers and she send the man away furious with the accusation that she would forget a child on the side of the road. The man returns to the spot where he found the child and tries to just abandon it there again, but a police officer is watching him closely. So our protagonist moves onward with the child and sees some man walking along the road. Promply he attempts to get rid of the responsibility by pretending to need to tie his shoelaces so he would hold the baby but instead he runs away and escapes before the second man can catch up. The second man is now tasked with the infant and discovers the trolley of the aforementioned mother and he puts the child in the trolley when she is not paying attention and flees the scene. The Woman returns and is furious to find the child once again in her trolley as our protagonist happens to pass by she wails on him with her umbrella and makes him take back the child he briefly got rid of. Defeated our protagonist takes a rest on the sidewalk. As he does he finds a slip of paper tugged away in the rags of the infant. On the paper it is written that the child is an orphan and the plea to care for it. The protagonist gets up with the child and moves somewhere unknown as the film ends.

A window opens and somebody throws several pieces of garbage out, missing Chaplin every time. Chaplin keeps strolling, not noticing anything. Another window opens, somebody throws out a big amount of garbage, apparently aiming at the trash can standing underneath the window. The garbage lands on Chaplin instead. He's startled and apparently feels awkward, so he takes off his gloves and lights himself a cigarette. Not wanting to put his gloves back on, he throws them into the trash can and leaves. At the corner of the street he finds a baby lying on the ground, crying. He picks it up, gazes at the houses surrounding him. Just at that moment a mother with a child in a stroller walks by and enters a house, leaving the stroller in front of the open door. Chaplin puts the baby into the stroller when the mother comes back. She seems furious, aggressively asks him to take the baby back. Chaplin grabs the baby, they both leave in opposite directions. Chaplin goes back to the corner where he found the baby, puts it on the ground. At that moment, a police officer walks by and witnesses Chaplin leaving the baby. Chaplin attempts to leave the place, turns around, sees the police officer, picks up the baby again and leaves. Next scene. An old man with a walking stick walks down a street, Chaplin is approaching from behind. He pretends that he needs to tie his shoe, gives the baby to the man, then runs away, hiding behind a corner. The old man runs after him. When he can't find him, he notices a stroller standing in front of a house. He puts the baby into the stroller and leaves. Moments later, when Chaplin accidentally walks by, the mother comes out of the house, seeing an additional baby in the stroller and Chaplin walking by. She gets furious again, runs after him and beats him with her umbrella. They argue over the baby in the stroller, when the police officer walks by. The woman gesticulates wildly. Chaplin picks up the baby again and leaves. Next scene. Chaplin sits down on the pavement, a gully next to him. He opens it, pparently thinking about dropping the baby down the gully. He discards the idea and examines the babie's clothes instead, finding a note. The note says ""Please love and care for this orphaned child"". Chaplin looks at the babie's face, smiles, gets up and leaves with the baby."

He picks up the baby and is convinced that he has found the mother when he sees a woman with a buggy walking by. Indicating that it is not her baby, the woman refuses to take the child. The protagonist puts the baby down on the ground and apparently wants to walk off when a police officer enters the scene whereupon the protagonist changes his mind and picks up the baby again. In an attempt to solve the situation, the protagonist hands the baby over to a stranger in the streets and runs off. Irritated, the stranger tries to chase the protagonist but as he is not able to find him he puts the baby in a buggy of a woman, who, by conincidence, is the same woman from the scene in the beginning. When she sees the protagonist passing by, she runs after him and hits him with her umbrella, obviously convinced that he again had put the baby in the buggy. In the final scene of the video, after comtemplating to drop the baby in the sewerage, the protagonist finds a note on the baby saying that the child is an orphan that needs love and caring. The protagonist seems to changes his mind and walks off with the baby and a smile on his face.		{'In': 3, 'the': 34, 'first': 1, 'scene': 4, 'protagonist': 8, 'is': 6, 'walking': 2, 'through': 1, 'streets': 2, 'when': 3, 'he': 6, 'finds': 2, 'a': 9, 'baby': 11, 'laying': 1, 'on': 4, 'floor': 1, 'and': 9, 'no': 1, 'parents': 1, 'in': 6, 'sight': 1, '.': 9, 'He': 1, 'picks': 2, 'up': 2, 'convinced': 2, 'that': 5, 'has': 1, 'found': 1, 'mother': 1, 'sees': 2, 'woman': 4, 'with': 3, 'buggy': 3, 'by': 3, 'Indicating': 1, 'it': 1, 'not': 2, 'her': 2, ',': 10, 'refuses': 1, 'to': 8, 'take': 1, 'child': 2, 'The': 2, 'puts': 2, 'down': 1, 'ground': 1, 'apparently': 1, 'wants': 1, 'walk': 1, 'off': 3, 'police': 1, 'officer': 1, 'enters': 1, 'whereupon': 1, 'changes': 2, 'his': 3, 'mind': 2, 'again': 2, 'an': 2, 'attempt': 1, 'solve': 1, 'situation': 1, 'hands': 1, 'over': 1, 'stranger': 2, 'runs': 2, 'Irritated': 1, 'tries': 1, 'chase': 1, 'but': 1, 'as': 1, 'able': 1, 'find': 1, 'him': 3, 'of': 2, 'who': 1, 'conincidence': 1, 'same': 1, 'from': 1, 'beginning': 1, 'When': 1, 'she': 2, 'passing': 1, 'after': 2, 'hits': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'obviously': 1, 'had': 1, 'put': 1, 'final': 1, 'video': 1, 'comtemplating': 1, 'drop': 1, 'sewerage': 1, 'note': 1, 'saying': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'needs': 1, 'love': 1, 'caring': 1, 'seems': 1, 'walks': 1, 'smile': 1, 'face': 1}	{'ADP': 32, 'DET': 48, 'ADJ': 7, 'NOUN': 57, 'AUX': 8, 'VERB': 37, 'SCONJ': 10, 'PRON': 20, 'CCONJ': 10, 'PUNCT': 19, 'PART': 9, 'ADV': 5}

After lighting his cigar he sees a baby laying between the garbage cans nearby. Willing to get rid of the child he tries to put it in a stroller of a strange woman, who, however is chasing him away. An attempt to put the baby back to where he found it is interrupted by a policeman and fails, so that the man then tries to trick a passerby into taking care of the child. The passerby however then puts the baby in the stroller in which it was previously laid and leaves. When the woman recognizes this she places the baby in the care of the first man to be introduced, who is unfortunately passing her, with the help of the policeman. The man sits down on the pavement and finds a letter inside the baby's clothes, informing him that the baby is orphaned. Upon getting to know this the man seems touched and rocks the child lovingly.

What follows is his struggle to find someone to take care of the baby: First of all he tries to hand the baby to a woman passing by with a pram. However, she angrily refuses to take it. That's why he sees no other possibilty than putting the baby back to where he initially found it, but as a police officer enters the scene, Choplin has to leave with the baby. In his following attempts to find someone else to look after the little kid, he puts it in the arms of a random stranger and then runs away. This elder man, now being in the same situation as Choplin before, also discovers the pram and decides to put the baby in there. The woman, just leaving the neighbouring building, finds the baby again in her pram. As Choplin coincidentally passes by, she assumes it was him who left the baby there. He gets beaten up by the woman with an umbrella and is forced to take the kid back. Choplin considers leaving it in the canalisation, however, he feels conflicted and hesitates. He then discovers a note hidden in the blanket wrapped around the baby. It says ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". Choplin thus decides to take care of the little kid himself and leaves with the baby on his arms."

Chaplin	written_online	40.0	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (German/English)	In the video you can see Charlie Chaplin casually walking down a street, smoking a cigarette. Almost being hit by an object which appears to be a brick, that a lady has thrown out of a window located right above his head, he has to take a step to the side. He keeps on walking and only a few seconds later he actually does get hit by another item that has been thrown out of the window. It is not easy to tell what the aforementioned object is but it looks like a bundle of branches and leaves. A little text pops up saying 'awkward ass'. Chaplin looks up to the window and then takes a box of cigarettes and cigars out of his jacket's inside pocket. He eventually takes out a cigarette and lights it after having taken off his leather gloves. He discards the taken off gloves and he discovers a baby lying in the corner of the street, wrapped in a blanket, screaming. Chaplin looks up in confusion assuming that the baby has been dropped out of a window as well and he picks it up. With the baby in his arms he struts to a lady's pushchair, which already has one child in it, and he carefully puts the new found infant in it too. Another text pops up saying 'Pardon me! You dropped something'. The woman, who did not see Chaplin at first, now spots him and furiously starts an argument. As a consequence, Chaplin now takes back the child and attempts to put it back to the place where he found it in the first place. However, this was prevented by a policeman looking at him strictly. Chaplin gives him an apologising look and picks up the baby again. He marches around the corner with the baby in his hands and sees an old man with a walking stick. Chaplin asks the man to hold the baby so that he could tie his shoelaces. He bends down but when the man did not look, Chaplin hurries away with the old man following him. Having lost sight of Chaplin, the elderly man finds the pushchair and places the baby in it, just like Chaplin attempted to do it earlier in the video. Leaving his hiding place, Chaplin encounters the police officer again and changes his direction to not have to pass him. Now the woman sees the second baby lying in the pushchair again and looks around trying to find the person being guilty of this. Coincidentally Chaplin walks past the lady in this exact moment and the women, recognising Chaplin from the earlier incident, knocks him down with her umbrella. After a heated discussion between these two, the police officer joins them but he remains silent. Finally, Chaplin takes the baby again and sits down with it on the pavement. He thinks about throwing the baby into the sewers but then reconsiders. In the end he finds a note that has been attached to the baby's blanket saying 'please love and care for this orphan child'. Looking at the baby's complexion, he smiles and leaves taking the baby with him.

Unidentifiable materials are being thrown out of the windows of the houses on both sides of the alley causing Chaplinˋs mood to darken. As he comes to a stop lighting himself a cigarette, Chaplin sees a baby wrapped in blankets lying on the ground. He picks it up carefully and decides to place it in a baby carriage of a woman standing nearby. As he makes an attempt to do so, telling the woman that she dropped something, the woman gets angry. Chaplin picks the baby up reluctantly and puts it exactly in the same place he found it. A police officer approaching behind Chaplin causes him to pick the baby up once more. On his way through the alleys he gives the foundling to an old man quickly running away. By chance, the old man places the baby in the same baby carriage in which Chaplin had already put it. As the owner comes out of the shop before which the baby carriage had stood unobserved, she sees the baby. Chaplin who walks by that moment is persuaded by the woman and the approaching police officer to take the baby with him a last time. Defeated in his trys to hand over the baby to someone else Chaplin sits down on the sidewalk. A short moment he thinks about putting the baby into the drain. Followed by his decision not to do so, Chaplin finds a note hidden in the babyˋs blankets asking the finder to care for the orphan child. Chaplin walks away cradling the baby gently.		{'The': 1, 'given': 1, 'excerpt': 1, 'from': 1, 'a': 8, 'Charlie': 1, 'Chaplin': 10, 'movie': 1, 'begins': 1, 'with': 2, 'walking': 1, 'down': 2, 'an': 3, 'alley': 2, '.': 15, 'Unidentifiable': 1, 'materials': 1, 'are': 1, 'being': 1, 'thrown': 1, 'out': 2, 'of': 5, 'the': 29, 'windows': 1, 'houses': 1, 'on': 3, 'both': 1, 'sides': 1, 'causing': 1, 'Chaplinˋs': 1, 'mood': 1, 'to': 11, 'darken': 1, 'As': 3, 'he': 5, 'comes': 2, 'stop': 1, 'lighting': 1, 'himself': 1, 'cigarette': 1, ',': 6, 'sees': 2, 'baby': 12, 'wrapped': 1, 'in': 7, 'blankets': 2, 'lying': 1, 'ground': 1, 'He': 1, 'picks': 2, 'it': 5, 'up': 3, 'carefully': 1, 'and': 3, 'decides': 1, 'place': 2, 'carriage': 3, 'woman': 4, 'standing': 1, 'nearby': 1, 'makes': 1, 'attempt': 1, 'do': 2, 'so': 2, 'telling': 1, 'that': 2, 'she': 2, 'dropped': 1, 'something': 1, 'gets': 1, 'angry': 1, 'reluctantly': 1, 'puts': 1, 'exactly': 1, 'same': 2, 'found': 1, 'A': 2, 'police': 2, 'officer': 2, 'approaching': 2, 'behind': 1, 'causes': 1, 'him': 2, 'pick': 1, 'once': 1, 'more': 1, 'On': 1, 'his': 3, 'way': 1, 'through': 1, 'alleys': 1, 'gives': 1, 'foundling': 1, 'old': 2, 'man': 2, 'quickly': 1, 'running': 1, 'away': 2, 'By': 1, 'chance': 1, 'places': 1, 'which': 2, 'had': 2, 'already': 1, 'put': 1, 'owner': 1, 'shop': 1, 'before': 1, 'stood': 1, 'unobserved': 1, 'who': 1, 'walks': 2, 'by': 3, 'moment': 2, 'is': 1, 'persuaded': 1, 'take': 1, 'last': 1, 'time': 1, 'Defeated': 1, 'trys': 1, 'hand': 1, 'over': 1, 'someone': 1, 'else': 1, 'sits': 1, 'sidewalk': 1, 'short': 1, 'thinks': 1, 'about': 1, 'putting': 1, 'into': 1, 'drain': 1, 'Followed': 1, 'decision': 1, 'not': 1, 'finds': 1, 'note': 1, 'hidden': 1, 'babyˋs': 1, 'asking': 1, 'finder': 1, 'care': 1, 'for': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'child': 1, 'cradling': 1, 'gently': 1}	{'DET': 45, 'VERB': 48, 'NOUN': 59, 'ADP': 40, 'PROPN': 12, 'PUNCT': 21, 'ADJ': 9, 'AUX': 7, 'PART': 9, 'SCONJ': 3, 'PRON': 25, 'ADV': 14, 'CCONJ': 3}

He picks it up and tries to get rid of it. A woman with a child in a buggy walks by. The man thinks the baby belongs to her and places the baby in the buggy. The woman, however, becomes angry and hands the baby back to the man. He walks back to where he found the baby and places it on the ground again. When he turns around, he finds a police officer watching him, and, guiltily, picks the baby up again and walks away. In the next scene you see him handing the child to a stranger on the street and running away. The stranger finds the buggy with the child, whose mother is in a shop at that time, again and also places the baby there. Just as the mother discovers the second baby again, the main character walks by and she becomes angry again. She hands him the child, and he sits down next to the street and takes a closer look.

In the end of the video it looks as if Charlie is keeping the baby, because he walk away with it in his arms.

After a few meters he eventually gets hits by trash and starts to complain. Afterwards he lights a cigarette to calm down and starts to notice a baby which is laying near some trash bins. He picks the baby up and wrongly assumes that it belongs to a passing woman who has a stroller. After putting the baby in the stroller, the woman complains and Charles picks the baby up again. The moment he put the baby back to where he found it, a police officer notices him. Out of guilt Charles picks up the baby again immediately. Under the excuse of having to tie his shoe, he gets an old man to hold the baby but runs away shortly after. The old man is following him angrily but lost him and notices a nearby standing stroller. He puts the baby inside and leaves. Charles left his hiding spot and was forced to move into the same direction as the old man was previously because of a nearby police officer. As Charles passes the stroller, the woman, which he angered earlier, comes out and notices the baby. She assumes that Charles put it inside her stroller again and hits him with her umbrella. This draws the attention of a police officer which forces Charles to take the child again. He walks down the road and ends up sitting on the side of the pavement. Shortly after he finds a small piece of paper in the clothes of the child which states that the child is an orphan and that he should be loved and taken care of. Charles ends up smiling and walks into the distance with the baby.		{'Charles': 8, 'Chaplin': 1, 'is': 5, 'walking': 1, 'down': 3, 'an': 3, 'alley': 1, ',': 7, 'while': 1, 'at': 1, 'first': 1, 'avoiding': 1, 'falling': 1, 'garbage': 1, 'which': 5, 'thrown': 1, 'out': 2, 'of': 9, 'surrounding': 1, 'houses': 1, '.': 17, 'After': 2, 'a': 10, 'few': 1, 'meters': 1, 'he': 8, 'eventually': 1, 'gets': 2, 'hits': 2, 'by': 1, 'trash': 2, 'and': 13, 'starts': 2, 'to': 9, 'complain': 1, 'Afterwards': 1, 'lights': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'calm': 1, 'notice': 1, 'baby': 10, 'laying': 1, 'near': 1, 'some': 1, 'bins': 1, 'He': 3, 'picks': 3, 'the': 25, 'up': 5, 'wrongly': 1, 'assumes': 2, 'that': 4, 'it': 3, 'belongs': 1, 'passing': 1, 'woman': 3, 'who': 1, 'has': 1, 'stroller': 5, 'putting': 1, 'in': 2, 'complains': 1, 'again': 4, 'The': 2, 'moment': 1, 'put': 2, 'back': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'police': 3, 'officer': 3, 'notices': 3, 'him': 4, 'Out': 1, 'guilt': 1, 'immediately': 1, 'Under': 1, 'excuse': 1, 'having': 1, 'tie': 1, 'his': 2, 'shoe': 1, 'old': 3, 'man': 3, 'hold': 1, 'but': 2, 'runs': 1, 'away': 1, 'shortly': 1, 'after': 2, 'following': 1, 'angrily': 1, 'lost': 1, 'nearby': 2, 'standing': 1, 'puts': 1, 'inside': 2, 'leaves': 1, 'left': 1, 'hiding': 1, 'spot': 1, 'was': 2, 'forced': 1, 'move': 1, 'into': 2, 'same': 1, 'direction': 1, 'as': 1, 'previously': 1, 'because': 1, 'As': 1, 'passes': 1, 'angered': 1, 'earlier': 1, 'comes': 1, 'She': 1, 'her': 2, 'with': 2, 'umbrella': 1, 'This': 1, 'draws': 1, 'attention': 1, 'forces': 1, 'take': 1, 'child': 3, 'walks': 2, 'road': 1, 'ends': 2, 'sitting': 1, 'on': 1, 'side': 1, 'pavement': 1, 'Shortly': 1, 'finds': 1, 'small': 1, 'piece': 1, 'paper': 1, 'clothes': 1, 'states': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'should': 1, 'be': 1, 'loved': 1, 'taken': 1, 'care': 1, 'smiling': 1, 'distance': 1}	{'PROPN': 9, 'AUX': 9, 'VERB': 57, 'ADP': 35, 'DET': 41, 'NOUN': 59, 'PUNCT': 24, 'SCONJ': 10, 'ADV': 19, 'PRON': 30, 'ADJ': 8, 'CCONJ': 15, 'PART': 7}

He then stops to light a cigar and notices a crying baby next to trash bin, first checking if someone is visible who might have thrown it in the trash from the windows like the trash that was thrown at him. He sees nothing, but then a woman with a baby stroller walks by and, assuming it must be hers, he places the baby he found in the stroller with the baby that is already in there. When the woman sees this, she gets angry at him and tells him to take the baby back, angrily walking away with her baby after he does so. After this, the man tries to place the baby back next to the bin where he found it but a policeman sees this and makes him take the baby back again. Following this incident, he sees an elderly man walking on a cane and tricks him into taking the baby, running away immediately when he does so. The elderly man also happens upon the stroller of the woman from earlier and also places the baby in it with the other baby, but again the woman sees this and gets angry, but at the younger man who placed it there earlier since he happens to be walking by at that moment. With the help of the policeman from before, she makes the younger man take the baby back again. The man then sits down on a sidewalk with the baby, not seeming to know what to do, when he finds a note in the babys blankets that states that the baby is an orphan and asks for someone to love and care for the baby. His demeanor towards the baby changes following this, he starts actually looking at it and smiling, then walks away with the baby in his arms.		{'A': 1, 'man': 7, 'walks': 3, 'along': 1, 'a': 9, 'rough': 1, 'and': 11, 'dirty': 1, 'looking': 2, 'street': 1, ',': 17, 'getting': 1, 'trash': 4, 'thrown': 3, 'at': 6, 'him': 6, 'from': 4, 'windows': 2, 'multiple': 1, 'times': 1, '.': 10, 'He': 2, 'then': 4, 'stops': 1, 'to': 9, 'light': 1, 'cigar': 1, 'notices': 1, 'crying': 1, 'baby': 17, 'next': 2, 'bin': 2, 'first': 1, 'checking': 1, 'if': 1, 'someone': 2, 'is': 3, 'visible': 1, 'who': 2, 'might': 1, 'have': 1, 'it': 6, 'in': 6, 'the': 29, 'like': 1, 'that': 5, 'was': 1, 'sees': 5, 'nothing': 1, 'but': 4, 'woman': 4, 'with': 6, 'stroller': 3, 'by': 2, 'assuming': 1, 'must': 1, 'be': 2, 'hers': 1, 'he': 9, 'places': 2, 'found': 2, 'already': 1, 'there': 2, 'When': 1, 'this': 6, 'she': 2, 'gets': 2, 'angry': 2, 'tells': 1, 'take': 3, 'back': 4, 'angrily': 1, 'walking': 3, 'away': 3, 'her': 1, 'after': 1, 'does': 2, 'so': 2, 'After': 1, 'tries': 1, 'place': 1, 'where': 1, 'policeman': 2, 'makes': 2, 'again': 3, 'Following': 1, 'incident': 1, 'an': 2, 'elderly': 2, 'on': 2, 'cane': 1, 'tricks': 1, 'into': 1, 'taking': 1, 'running': 1, 'immediately': 1, 'when': 2, 'The': 2, 'also': 2, 'happens': 2, 'upon': 1, 'of': 2, 'earlier': 2, 'other': 1, 'younger': 2, 'placed': 1, 'since': 1, 'moment': 1, 'With': 1, 'help': 1, 'before': 1, 'sits': 1, 'down': 1, 'sidewalk': 1, 'not': 1, 'seeming': 1, 'know': 1, 'what': 1, 'do': 1, 'finds': 1, 'note': 1, 'babys': 1, 'blankets': 1, 'states': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'asks': 1, 'for': 2, 'love': 1, 'care': 1, 'His': 1, 'demeanor': 1, 'towards': 1, 'changes': 1, 'following': 1, 'starts': 1, 'actually': 1, 'smiling': 1, 'his': 1, 'arms': 1}	{'DET': 45, 'NOUN': 55, 'VERB': 59, 'ADP': 37, 'ADJ': 11, 'CCONJ': 15, 'PUNCT': 27, 'PRON': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PART': 9, 'PROPN': 1, 'SCONJ': 9, 'AUX': 9}

Afterwards he tries to get rid of the baby. He wants to leave the child in the alley, but is stopped by a police officer. His next attempt appears succesful at first. Chaplin hands the baby to an elderly man before quickly running away.  However, the elderly man proceeds to do exactly what Chaplin tried at first. He puts the baby in the baby carriage of the woman we saw earlier. She notices this when Chaplin walks past her, assuming this was his doing. She beats him up und returns the baby to him. Annoyed, he sits down on the sidewalk, where he is tempted to throw the baby into the drain for a second. He hesitates and finds a letter under the childs wrap. It states that the baby is an orphan and asks for someone to love and care for the child. This moves Chaplin and he takes the baby with him with a smile on his face.		{'In': 1, 'the': 21, 'video': 1, ',': 8, 'Chaplin': 5, 'walks': 3, 'through': 1, 'a': 8, 'run': 1, '-': 1, 'down': 2, 'neighbourhood': 1, 'where': 2, 'he': 5, 'stumbles': 1, 'upon': 1, 'baby': 11, 'laying': 1, 'on': 3, 'ground': 1, '.': 15, 'He': 4, 'assumes': 1, 'was': 2, 'lost': 1, 'by': 2, 'woman': 3, 'who': 1, 'past': 2, 'him': 4, 'with': 3, 'carriage': 2, 'His': 2, 'attempt': 2, 'to': 8, 'return': 1, 'child': 4, 'is': 5, 'futile': 1, 'however': 1, 'as': 1, 'vehemently': 1, 'states': 2, 'that': 2, 'this': 3, 'not': 1, 'her': 2, 'Afterwards': 1, 'tries': 1, 'get': 1, 'rid': 1, 'of': 2, 'wants': 1, 'leave': 1, 'in': 2, 'alley': 1, 'but': 1, 'stopped': 1, 'police': 1, 'officer': 1, 'next': 1, 'appears': 1, 'succesful': 1, 'at': 2, 'first': 2, 'hands': 1, 'an': 2, 'elderly': 2, 'man': 2, 'before': 1, 'quickly': 1, 'running': 1, 'away': 1, ' ': 1, 'However': 1, 'proceeds': 1, 'do': 1, 'exactly': 1, 'what': 1, 'tried': 1, 'puts': 1, 'we': 1, 'saw': 1, 'earlier': 1, 'She': 2, 'notices': 1, 'when': 1, 'assuming': 1, 'his': 2, 'doing': 1, 'beats': 1, 'up': 1, 'und': 1, 'returns': 1, 'Annoyed': 1, 'sits': 1, 'sidewalk': 1, 'tempted': 1, 'throw': 1, 'into': 1, 'drain': 1, 'for': 3, 'second': 1, 'hesitates': 1, 'and': 4, 'finds': 1, 'letter': 1, 'under': 1, 'childs': 1, 'wrap': 1, 'It': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'asks': 1, 'someone': 1, 'love': 1, 'care': 1, 'This': 1, 'moves': 1, 'takes': 1, 'smile': 1, 'face': 1}	{'ADP': 29, 'DET': 31, 'NOUN': 40, 'PUNCT': 24, 'PROPN': 5, 'VERB': 39, 'SCONJ': 7, 'PRON': 30, 'AUX': 8, 'PART': 7, 'ADJ': 6, 'ADV': 10, 'CCONJ': 5, 'SPACE': 1}

The main protagonist is shown walking along a small alley minding his own business, when a series of events unfolds. People are throwing garbage (?) out of their windows, while trying to aim for trash cans but missing them and almost hitting the main protagonist. Soon after that he pulls a box of cigarettes out of his jacket and starts to smoke. While he smokes he realises there is a baby lying on the street right next to him. Curiously he is looking for the parents or someone who might have dropped the baby there but cannot seem to find someone on the first look. However, when he turns around he spots a woman with a stroller and walks towards her. She disappears into a house and he puts the baby into the stroller, supposing she is the mother. The woman appears again and they start to argue, which implies she is not the mother. After almost taking her child, the protagonist picks up the child he found on the street. He then returns to the spot he found the baby in and is placing it there the way he stumbled upon it. When he turns around, there is a police officer standing in front of him, which leads to the protagonist promptly picking up the baby again, because of the implications.  He then walks away and as he passes another man, he pretends he needs to clean his shoes and signals the other man to hold the baby for a second, because he needs both hands in order to clean his footwear. As soon as the other man is holding the baby, the protagonis makes a run for it and hides somewhere in the previously shown alley. While looking for the protagonist, the second man comes across the same stroller shown before, getting the same idea as the protagonist and placing the baby in the woman's stroller. This time the woman does not realise that immediately as she is not present during this event. The moment she appears again and sees the second baby, the protagonist walks by her which leads her to running after him and hitting him with her umbrella, forcing him to take the baby again. He then sits down on a pavement and contemplates dropping the baby in the sewer. He takes a closer look at the baby and inside the blankets covering the baby, there is a letter with the words ""Please love and care for this orphan child."". This immediately changes the protagonist's stance towards the child as he realises the parents are not around anymore to raise the baby and he feels responsible for it now and walks away as a newfound father."

Due to residents tossing their trash out of the window he almost gets hit by trash twice until eventually the third hit scores.  <br/> He looses his cigarette, takes out a new one and ignights it, ready to keep walking. <br/> But behind a barrel he finds a crying baby bundled up in rags. After looking around for someone close who might have placed the baby there, Chaplin picks it up and places it in the stroller of a mother passing by, claiming she 'dropped' the baby. The mother protests since there's already a baby in her stroller and the found one isn't hers. Chaplin hastily picks the baby up again and wants to put it back where he found it but a policeman spots him doing so, which caused Chaplin to pick the baby up again and walk out of the alley. <br/>  <br/> In passing he meets an old man with a crutch, pretends his shoelaces are undone and asks the man to hold the baby while he ties his shoelaces again. But the moment the old man focusses on the baby Chaplin runs off, hiding in the alley. <br/> The old man can't find Chaplin but spots the stroller from earlier in front of a shop in which he puts the baby before he walks off. <br/>  <br/> Eventually the mother comes back out of the shop and notices the foreign baby in her stroller. Coincidentally Chaplin passes by again and the mother thinks he put the baby in her stroller again. She runs after him, smacks him with her umbrella and drags him back to the stroller, fighting with him over the baby. Only when a policeman takes notice of the turmoil Chaplin hastily grabs the baby and rushes off. <br/>  <br/> They sit down on the sidewalk close to a drain. And for a moment Chaplin considers putting the baby in there but decides against it. He shrugs at the baby and takes a closer look at the rags covering it as he notices a piece of paper, asking the finder of the baby to take care of the orphan.  <br/>  <br/> In the end Chaplin takes the baby with him with a smile.

While walking, he gets something thrown on him twice. He then stops to light another cigarette and suddenly notices a newborn baby lying on the ground in a corner. He picks up the crying baby and tries to get rid of it by radomly placing it into the hands of other people he comes across. But somehow the unwanted baby always finds a way back to him. At the same time, a guard or police officer is suspiciously watching the events surrounding the man and the baby. In the end, the man sits down on the pavement and slowly starts to accept his fate and duty to take care of the baby. He then takes a closer look at the baby and finds a note attached to its clothes in which it is revealed that the baby is an orphan.		{'A': 1, 'man': 3, ',': 5, 'dressed': 1, 'in': 3, 'a': 7, 'sort': 1, 'of': 4, 'shabby': 1, '-': 1, 'looking': 1, 'suit': 1, 'and': 7, 'rather': 1, 'large': 1, 'shoes': 1, 'walks': 1, 'down': 2, 'the': 15, 'street': 1, 'while': 1, 'smoking': 1, '.': 8, 'While': 1, 'walking': 1, 'he': 2, 'gets': 1, 'something': 1, 'thrown': 1, 'on': 3, 'him': 2, 'twice': 1, 'He': 3, 'then': 2, 'stops': 1, 'to': 6, 'light': 1, 'another': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'suddenly': 1, 'notices': 1, 'newborn': 1, 'baby': 7, 'lying': 1, 'ground': 1, 'corner': 1, 'picks': 1, 'up': 1, 'crying': 1, 'tries': 1, 'get': 1, 'rid': 1, 'it': 3, 'by': 1, 'radomly': 1, 'placing': 1, 'into': 1, 'hands': 1, 'other': 1, 'people': 1, 'comes': 1, 'across': 1, 'But': 1, 'somehow': 1, 'unwanted': 1, 'always': 1, 'finds': 2, 'way': 1, 'back': 1, 'At': 1, 'same': 1, 'time': 1, 'guard': 1, 'or': 1, 'police': 1, 'officer': 1, 'is': 3, 'suspiciously': 1, 'watching': 1, 'events': 1, 'surrounding': 1, 'In': 1, 'end': 1, 'sits': 1, 'pavement': 1, 'slowly': 1, 'starts': 1, 'accept': 1, 'his': 1, 'fate': 1, 'duty': 1, 'take': 1, 'care': 1, 'takes': 1, 'closer': 1, 'look': 1, 'at': 1, 'note': 1, 'attached': 1, 'its': 1, 'clothes': 1, 'which': 1, 'revealed': 1, 'that': 1, 'an': 1, 'orphan': 1}	{'DET': 25, 'NOUN': 35, 'PUNCT': 14, 'VERB': 28, 'ADP': 20, 'ADJ': 7, 'CCONJ': 9, 'ADV': 11, 'SCONJ': 3, 'PRON': 14, 'PART': 4, 'AUX': 4}

A man is cleaning out in one of the windows above. Charlie dodges the dirt-fall and stays unimpressed. At the next garbage can he rolls himself a cigarette. He has just started smoking when he suddenly notices a baby lying next to a trash can. It is crying helplessly but the parents are no where to be seen. Thus Charly Chaplin picks it up. Next thing he sees is a woman with a pram and one baby. She seems to be searching for something and dissappears, leaving her pram behind. Assuming that the baby belongs to this woman, CC puts the baby right next to the other child. Just a second later she is back  and makes perfectly clear that this is not her baby. CC takes it back and she disappears. <br/> This beginning scene is followed by some others, showing CC trying to get rid of the unwanted baby. Funnily the plot is not with Charlie. The baby keeps coming back one or the other way. <br/>  <br/> Exhausted Charlie sits down at the garter. What is he supposed to do? He is playing with the baby when he suddenly finds a letter hidden in the folds of the blanket. The baby is an orphant he learns with no parents. CC decides to keep the baby. He huddles it into his arms and walks away.		{'Charlie': 4, 'Chaplin': 2, 'is': 13, 'walking': 1, 'down': 2, 'a': 8, 'deserted': 1, 'road': 1, '.': 22, 'The': 3, 'music': 1, 'relaxed': 1, ',': 4, 'he': 7, 'smoking': 2, 'confidently': 1, 'Suddenly': 1, 'dirt': 2, 'falls': 1, 'on': 1, 'his': 2, 'head': 1, 'A': 1, 'man': 1, 'cleaning': 1, 'out': 1, 'in': 2, 'one': 3, 'of': 3, 'the': 15, 'windows': 1, 'above': 1, 'dodges': 1, '-': 1, 'fall': 1, 'and': 6, 'stays': 1, 'unimpressed': 1, 'At': 1, 'next': 3, 'garbage': 1, 'can': 2, 'rolls': 1, 'himself': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'He': 3, 'has': 1, 'just': 1, 'started': 1, 'when': 2, 'suddenly': 2, 'notices': 1, 'baby': 10, 'lying': 1, 'to': 8, 'trash': 1, 'It': 1, 'crying': 1, 'helplessly': 1, 'but': 1, 'parents': 2, 'are': 1, 'no': 2, 'where': 1, 'be': 2, 'seen': 1, 'Thus': 1, 'Charly': 1, 'picks': 1, 'it': 3, 'up': 1, 'Next': 1, 'thing': 1, 'sees': 1, 'woman': 2, 'with': 4, 'pram': 2, 'She': 1, 'seems': 1, 'searching': 1, 'for': 1, 'something': 1, 'dissappears': 1, 'leaving': 1, 'her': 2, 'behind': 1, 'Assuming': 1, 'that': 2, 'belongs': 1, 'this': 2, 'CC': 4, 'puts': 1, 'right': 1, 'other': 2, 'child': 1, 'Just': 1, 'second': 1, 'later': 1, 'she': 2, 'back': 3, ' ': 2, 'makes': 1, 'perfectly': 1, 'clear': 1, 'not': 2, 'takes': 1, 'disappears': 1, '<': 3, 'br/': 3, '>': 3, 'This': 1, 'beginning': 1, 'scene': 1, 'followed': 1, 'by': 1, 'some': 1, 'others': 1, 'showing': 1, 'trying': 1, 'get': 1, 'rid': 1, 'unwanted': 1, 'Funnily': 1, 'plot': 1, 'keeps': 1, 'coming': 1, 'or': 1, 'way': 1, 'Exhausted': 1, 'sits': 1, 'at': 1, 'garter': 1, 'What': 1, 'supposed': 1, 'do': 1, '?': 1, 'playing': 1, 'finds': 1, 'letter': 1, 'hidden': 1, 'folds': 1, 'blanket': 1, 'an': 1, 'orphant': 1, 'learns': 1, 'decides': 1, 'keep': 1, 'huddles': 1, 'into': 1, 'arms': 1, 'walks': 1, 'away': 1}	{'PROPN': 10, 'AUX': 19, 'VERB': 43, 'ADP': 22, 'DET': 32, 'ADJ': 9, 'NOUN': 46, 'PUNCT': 28, 'PRON': 25, 'ADV': 21, 'NUM': 3, 'CCONJ': 8, 'SCONJ': 5, 'PART': 7, 'SPACE': 2, 'X': 6}

He is doing this in his typical penguin walk. As he is walking along, smoking a cigarette, a worker is throwing trash and brick parts out of the open windows of the first floor of one building. The trash smashes to the ground and Chaplin accelerates his steps but at the next corner, on the opposite side of the lane someone else is throwing down bricks. Chaplin just manages not to get hit, but his cigarette falls down. While trying to get another cigarette out of his tin box he sees a baby wrapped up in cloth just next to a trash bin. He looks up and around as if to find the person who had dropped the baby out of the window. <br/> He sees a woman pushing a pram passing by. He runs after her and put the new found baby into her pram. The woman is getting very angry with Chaplin, so he takes the baby back and tries to return it to the place he had found it. In that moment a police officer watches him and Chaplin decides to pick the baby up again. Next he comes past another man and he pretends having to tie his shoe laces and meanwhile keeps the man holding the baby. Chaplin quickly runs away. The man goes away and puts the baby into the pram in front of a shop. <br/> Chaplin is now strolling along the pavement, past the pram. The woman, comes out of the shop, sees two babies in her pram and then sees Chaplin. She runs after him to beat him up with her umbrella. Chaplin takes the baby again. <br/> Exhausted and clueless he sits down on the pavement in front of a house, looking at the baby. He is surprised to find a paper under the cloth the baby is wrapped in. It reads ""love me and care for me"". This message instantly brings a big smile to his Chaplins face. He starts to hug the baby warmheartedly, gets up and leaves together with the baby in his arms, still caressing it."

A man in a suit with a cigar in his hand walks down an alley. Suddenly a huge amount of brickbrittles falls before him from above and he stumbles. He is now standing in a small segment of the street with garbage cans surrounding him. The camera zooms in for a close-up as he goes on to opening a metal cigar case and extracting a white cigar. He rids himself of his gloves and lights his cigar. His gaze wanders and he spotts a crying baby behind one of the bins.  He picks the baby up and looks around. A women with a baby stroller hurries through the background, leaves the stroller unattended while shopping. He then places the baby in the stroller, however she returns prematurely and interupts him. He tries to put the baby back in the corner, yet a police officer arrives and dissuedes him from proceeding. Cut. The same man with the baby apears in a different alley and hands the baby over to a strange old man, who has  an obvious walking issue and runs away. The man with the walking issue again places the baby in the stroller of the previous lady and dissapears into thin air. The cigar guy walks past and the woman goes after him as she assumes, he is the one responsiple for placing the baby in her stroller again. As they argue the police officer reappears on set and the cigar guy gives in and takes the baby with him. The cigar guy sits down next to a drain and considers his further actions. He even thiks about throwing the baby into the sewer system, but reevaluates that thought. Between the sheets of fabric in which the baby is wrapped up he finds a paper on which is written: Please care for this orphan child.

An unseen person tosses trash out of the window, not minding the passersby underneath. When he eventually passes the window, he plays around with his walking stick before he is hit with more trash from another window. As it is a silent movie, the spoken text is shown in title cards, the first one says ""Awkward ass."" The man looks at the trash, the up towards the window and takes out a small box filled with cigars. To light one of them, he takes off his gloves and lights a match on the heel of his shoe. Then he throws his gloves away.  <br/> As he turns to the side, a baby is shown lying on the ground, seemingly abandoned. The man looks at the baby, then around as if he was searching for somebody responsible. When nobody is seen, he picks up the child. In the background, a woman appears from the left, pushing a stroller. The man attempts to get her attention and ends up following her to what seems to be her house. The stroller, which she left outside, is occupied by another child, older than the discovered baby, but the man wants to put the younger kid down nonetheless. When the woman re-appears, she is shocked, so the man tries to explain the situation by saying: ""Pardon me, you dropped something."" The woman does not seem to be happy about it and is shown yelling at the man, clearly indicating that this is not her child, so the man takes it with him once again. The woman storms off. <br/> Carrying the child back to the alley where he found it, the man wants to leave it there to be found by somebody else, but a police officers sees him doing it. When the man notices the officer, he promptly turns around once more, picks up the baby once more and leaves to the right side of the screen. <br/> A new alley is shown, with another man already walking along. The man walks up to him, stops, pretends that he has to tie his show laces and proceeds to hand him the child. He then runs off, leaving the baby to the stranger, but the new man follows. As the first man hides in a garage, the other one is looking for him, only to discover the stroller from before, still occupied by the other child. He puts the baby down, this time without the appearance of the mother. The man from the beginning, now child-less, dares to leave his hideout, only to run into the police man once more, so he quickly turns the other way. <br/> Meanwhile, the mother is shown, returning to her child where she finds the baby alongside it. However, as the man who actually placed it there has already left and the other man just happens to pass the stroller, she accuses him of leaving his child there. The accusation happens in the form of chasing him and hitting him with an umbrella, which causes the man to fall. She drags him back to the stroller, still hitting him as she does so. The police man comes out of an alley and notices the racket. The woman, still furious, explains the situation to him, which the man doesn't try to argue, so he only takes the baby and leaves the scene. As do the officer and the woman. <br/> In the next cut, the man standing on an empty sidewalk in front of a gutter. He sits down on the ground and opens said gutter. For a moment, he looks at the child, but then closes it again and only readjust his grip on the lump in his arms. for the first time, he looks at it more closely and discovers a small scrap of paper hidden in the folds of the blanket that is draped around the baby. ""Please love and care for this orphan child,"" is written on the paper. The man puts the paper away and looks at the baby again, smiling this time. In the last shot, he leaves to the end of the scenery."

he’s really annoyed by it it seems to be like that and uh / he then lights some uh cigarettes / and when walking around the corner I think uh he / discovers that there’s a child lying in the corner and he doesn’t seem to find a mother to it or anything so then he walks uh / around the corner walks a little bit and sees uh / an / a mother with a / hhh pushchair or something like that and uh he puts the baby in it / and kind of expects that it belongs to this mother because there’s another baby in it ‘n’ there’s room for a second one / so uh the mother obviously says it’s not my baby ‘n’ you can’t just drop it her= or she doesn’t say it but it looks like she says it / and / she then / uh so he then has to pick it up again and he decides that he just drops it back where he founds it / f= found it uh / but when he does that he / uh is uh / watched by a policeman / and because he doesn’t want any trouble or whatever hhh he picks it back up again / and just kind of walks away / and / then uh stumbling across an old man / and he acts like he has something stuck on his shoe / and therefore gives the baby to the old man / and / pretends like he’s cleaning his shoe but then running away really quickly ‘n’ the old man doesn’t / can’t follow / and / so when the old man doesn= know what to do with the baby he sees an / unsupervised pushchair / again with one baby the same pushchair that was there before / and put the baby in it / ‘n’ walks away / and doesn’t get caught by the mother / ‘n’ when the mother comes out and sees the second baby in it / exactly in that moment Charlie Chaplin walks by again / so she follows him ‘n’ kind of hits him with his with her umbrella / and / yeah / basically looks like she shouts at him to take this baby back ‘n’ that’s not hers / he then makes uh kind of the move to pick up the wrong baby / so the baby that’s actually the mother’s baby / and but in the end she he does pick up the baby that’s / uh the one that he’d apparently dropped / but I th= it seems like only because the policeman is standing next to them again / and yeah he then walks off / drops his / I guess you can call it the cane / uh no it’s not a cane because it’s not for a blind person but his walking stick whatever / and he then uh he drops it so he had to sit on the curve uh / curb / and / when / sitting there he has uh / kind of a drain next to him ‘n’ he looks into it / ‘n’ it looks like he uh / thinks about dropping the baby in there / but then he decides against it ‘n’ looks a little into the blankets that’s round and / uh kind of devel= / envelop the baby / and he finds a letter that says please / love and I think care for this orphan child / and he then / it seems like he has uh / kind of / doesn’t seem like he develops straightaway loving feelings but he seems to care about it more seeing as it is an orphan child and / he walks off with it ‘n’ it’s unknown to the viewer if it’s / if he put brings it to an orphanage or if he keeps it or

Suddenly, after lighting a cigarette, Charlie finds a baby at the side of the road. After some confusion, he decides to put it in the pushchair of a women, assuming she 'dropped' the baby. But she didn't and makes him take it back. Charlie's next idea is to just put it back where he found it, but a policeman catches him in the act, which makes Charlie take it back into his arms and walk off. Fooling an old man, he then manages to leave the baby in said man's arms, hiding from him until he thinks it's safe to come out. The old man has the same idea as Charlie originally and drops the baby in the pushchair. Upon leaving his hiding spot, he encounters the policeman again This makes him change directions quickly. By chance, he walks past the women and her pushchair again, thus making her believe he dropped the baby in there and so she beats him with her umbrella. The policeman makes another appearance and Charlie is yet again forced to take back the baby. Dropping his cane on the sidewalk, he sits down on the curb to retrieve it. He is wondering for a moment whether he should drop the baby down the drain, but quickly decides against it.

A mother walked by with her baby in a stroller and Mr. Chaplin put the baby he just found next to hers. But when she got angry about this baby that wasn't hers, he had to take it back. While Charlie Chaplin was putting the baby back to where he found it a police man approached. Seeing him Mr. Chaplin picked up the baby and walked around the corner. There he saw an older man with a walking cane. By telling him he needed to tie his shoe the old man took the baby for a moment, but Mr. Chaplin quickly ran away. Trying to chase him the man saw a baby in a stroller and put the one in his arms in there too. When the mother discovered the other baby she assumed Mr. Chaplin, who was walking by, did this again. When they started an argument the police man approached and Mr. Chaplin left with ""his"" baby. Upon sitting down on the pavement he found a piece of paper inside the baby's blanket.

Chaplin	written_online	7.0	Outside classroom		Charlie Chaplin walks down a narrow street and gets hit by the dirt that is thrown out of the window by the inhabitants of the houses. Angered by the incident he lights a cigarette. While smoking he finds an abandoned baby beside some dustbins. He picks it up and follows a passing woman with a stroller. He puts the baby in her stroller while commenting that she must have lost it. She argues and threatens him, so he picks up the baby and leaves. He wants to put the child back to where he found it, but a police officer follows him, so Chaplin does not dare to leave the child there. He passes an old man on the street and tricks him into taking the child. The old man puts the baby into a stroller standing outside a shop. The moment Chaplin passes by the stroller, the woman comes out again and notices the second child. The police officer reappears, so the woman accuses Chaplin. He takes the child and sits down at the roadside. He finds a piece of paper attached to the child, that asks the person who finds the orphan child to take care of it. Chaplin smiles at the baby and leaves with it.		{'Charlie': 1, 'Chaplin': 5, 'walks': 1, 'down': 2, 'a': 8, 'narrow': 1, 'street': 2, 'and': 8, 'gets': 1, 'hit': 1, 'by': 4, 'the': 22, 'dirt': 1, 'that': 3, 'is': 1, 'thrown': 1, 'out': 2, 'of': 4, 'window': 1, 'inhabitants': 1, 'houses': 1, '.': 14, 'Angered': 1, 'incident': 1, 'he': 4, 'lights': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'While': 1, 'smoking': 1, 'finds': 3, 'an': 2, 'abandoned': 1, 'baby': 5, 'beside': 1, 'some': 1, 'dustbins': 1, 'He': 6, 'picks': 2, 'it': 5, 'up': 2, 'follows': 2, 'passing': 1, 'woman': 3, 'with': 2, 'stroller': 4, 'puts': 2, 'in': 1, 'her': 1, 'while': 1, 'commenting': 1, 'she': 1, 'must': 1, 'have': 1, 'lost': 1, 'She': 1, 'argues': 1, 'threatens': 1, 'him': 3, ',': 6, 'so': 3, 'leaves': 2, 'wants': 1, 'to': 5, 'put': 1, 'child': 7, 'back': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'but': 1, 'police': 2, 'officer': 2, 'does': 1, 'not': 1, 'dare': 1, 'leave': 1, 'there': 1, 'passes': 2, 'old': 2, 'man': 2, 'on': 1, 'tricks': 1, 'into': 2, 'taking': 1, 'The': 3, 'standing': 1, 'outside': 1, 'shop': 1, 'moment': 1, 'comes': 1, 'again': 1, 'notices': 1, 'second': 1, 'reappears': 1, 'accuses': 1, 'takes': 1, 'sits': 1, 'at': 2, 'roadside': 1, 'piece': 1, 'paper': 1, 'attached': 1, 'asks': 1, 'person': 1, 'who': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'take': 1, 'care': 1, 'smiles': 1}	{'PROPN': 6, 'VERB': 42, 'ADP': 26, 'DET': 36, 'ADJ': 4, 'NOUN': 43, 'CCONJ': 9, 'AUX': 5, 'PRON': 24, 'PUNCT': 20, 'SCONJ': 5, 'ADV': 5, 'PART': 4}

he gets hit by something that’s falling out of the window or something stomping it from above which is like extin= extinguishing the cigarette then he gets out like a little metal box from his pocket and  picks another cigarette lights that one as he looks around he sees a little baby wrapped in a blanket laying on the floor next to a trash can and he picks up that baby looks around trying to figure out where it’s come from or if he could find someone that’s like the mom or the dad and in the background there’s a lady pushing a pram with another child in it so he calls out for her as he thinks maybe the baby belongs to her and as she doesn’t react he follows her and she enters into a building he just puts the baby in the pram she comes back out ‘n’ sees it ‘n’ then complains that’s not her child ‘n’ the two of them argue a bit she gets quite angry ‘n’ he gets the baby back out of the pram walks back to where he found it and then he just puts the baby next to the trash can ‘n’ wants to walks away but then there is a police officer of some sort behind him so he just picks the baby straight back up ‘n’ walks away with it then he kinda enters to another street and steps into like a puddle of mud or something like that ‘n’ there’s another man and he asks that man to hold the baby so he can clean up his shoes or his pants and as he gives the baby over to the other man he kinda pretends to clean his pants he just runs away and as the other man realizes that he follows him but he isn’t that fast because he’s got a walking stick and Charlie Chaplin then finds a a garage I think and the other man just kinda looks around for him and then sees the pram of that lady that Charlie went to ‘n’ puts the baby in ‘n’ walks away and then Charlie exits the garage ‘n’ wants to walk in the other direction but then there’s the police officer again so has to turn around walk the other way again ‘n’ then there’s as the lady that the pram belongs to that we’ve already seen before comes out of the building and realizes that the child is in her pram again he passes her and she like gets real angry he runs away she follows him hits with her umbrella and kinda drags him back to the pram which is also when the police officer comes by again and she complains that he again dropped the child into her pram snd that he should take it which he then does and walks away he kinda like takes that baby ‘n’ sits down side of the street with it and I don’t know he opens like a drainage cover it or something like that I don’t know contemplating to put the baby in there I’m not sure but then as he looks through the blankets that the baby is wrapped in he finds a letter that says please love ‘n’ care for this orphan child I think and after reading that he just picks up the baby again ‘n’ walks away I think		{'ok': 1, 'so': 5, 'in': 10, 'the': 40, 'video': 1, 'there': 7, '’s': 11, 'a': 18, 'man': 6, 'I': 8, 'suppose': 1, 'it': 10, 'Charlie': 4, 'Chaplin': 2, 'and':

Chaplin	written_online	11.0	Outside classroom		"The short film ""The Baby"", staring Charlie Chaplin in the lead role,is about the main character finding an abandoned Baby and trying to get rid of it again. <br/> The film starts with the main character walking down an alley way. He first nearly misses being hit with rubbel falling down from a window, walking further he is hit with rubbish from another house. Composing himself he takes a cigarette out of his cigaretteetiu and burns it. While doing so, he notices a baby laying next to some barrels, obviously abandoned. <br/> He then starts to look arround,maybe for the parents of the child or someone he can contact about this. He seems to think that he has found the mother and tries to bring her the baby back. It becomes obvious that the women is not the mother and does not want the baby either. <br/> Lost with what to do, the lead character treis to put the baby back where he found it, but is interrupted by an police man. Charlie Chaplins character, procedes to take the child with him as to not look like as if he was the one depositing the child in the ally. He tries, without success, to get rid of the child . <br/> In the end we see him sitting at the side of the road, reading a message, that was wriitten on a piece of paper and put in the Babys blanket. The maincharacter and the audience learn that the baby is an orphan. The main character, seemingly decides that he is going to keep the baby. At least one can see him walking of with it in the last shot."

He is startled and pauses to light a cigarette. He then finds a baby on the street that he tries to give to a women passing by with a buggy, assuming that it belongs to her. She seems to tell him that it’s not her child and Chaplin takes the baby back, trying to put it back where he found it. However, a police officer sees him and gives him a stern look which leads to Chaplin keeping the baby and quickly giving it to another man out of the officer’s sight. The man drops the baby into an unsupervised buggy which turns out to be the one belonging to the women we saw earlier. She sees Chaplin pass by, assumes that he put the baby there again and chases him with an umbrella, beating him with it. She and the officer then force Chaplin to take back the baby. Chaplin sits down at the side of the street with it and briefly seems to consider dropping it into a drain next to him. He then shrugs and finds a note attached to the blanket the baby is wrapped in that reads „please love and care for the orphan child“. Finally, he smiles at the baby and leaves, still holding it in his arms.		{'Chaplin': 6, 'walks': 1, 'nexts': 1, 'to': 15, 'a': 9, 'dilapidated': 1, 'building': 1, 'and': 11, 'then': 4, 'gets': 1, 'attacked': 1, 'by': 3, 'something': 1, ',': 9, 'possibly': 1, 'rubble': 1, 'or': 1, 'trash': 1, 'falling': 1, 'down': 2, 'on': 2, 'him': 7, '.': 11, 'He': 3, 'is': 2, 'startled': 1, 'pauses': 1, 'light': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'finds': 2, 'baby': 8, 'the': 16, 'street': 2, 'that': 5, 'he': 4, 'tries': 1, 'give': 1, 'women': 2, 'passing': 1, 'with': 4, 'buggy': 2, 'assuming': 1, 'it': 9, 'belongs': 1, 'her': 2, 'She': 3, 'seems': 2, 'tell': 1, '’s': 2, 'not': 1, 'child': 2, 'takes': 1, 'back': 3, 'trying': 1, 'put': 2, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'However': 1, 'police': 1, 'officer': 3, 'sees': 2, 'gives': 1, 'stern': 1, 'look': 1, 'which': 2, 'leads': 1, 'keeping': 1, 'quickly': 1, 'giving': 1, 'another': 1, 'man': 2, 'out': 2, 'of': 2, 'sight': 1, 'The': 1, 'drops': 1, 'into': 2, 'an': 2, 'unsupervised': 1, 'turns': 1, 'be': 1, 'one': 1, 'belonging': 1, 'we': 1, 'saw': 1, 'earlier': 1, 'pass': 1, 'assumes': 1, 'there': 1, 'again': 1, 'chases': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'beating': 1, 'force': 1, 'take': 1, 'sits': 1, 'at': 2, 'side': 1, 'briefly': 1, 'consider': 1, 'dropping': 1, 'drain': 1, 'next': 1, 'shrugs': 1, 'note': 1, 'attached': 1, 'blanket': 1, 'wrapped': 1, 'in': 2, 'reads': 1, '„': 1, 'please': 1, 'love': 1, 'care': 1, 'for': 1, 'orphan': 1, '“': 1, 'Finally': 1, 'smiles': 1, 'leaves': 1, 'still': 1, 'holding': 1, 'his': 1, 'arms': 1}	{'PROPN': 6, 'VERB': 47, 'NOUN': 37, 'ADP': 29, 'DET': 30, 'ADJ': 5, 'CCONJ': 12, 'ADV': 18, 'AUX': 4, 'PRON': 34, 'PUNCT': 22, 'PART': 9, 'SCONJ': 4, 'NUM': 1, 'INTJ': 1}

Charly continues walking towards the viewer, smoking a cigarette when another incident like this extinguishes his cigarette. He insults the person responsible as an awkward ass and then proceeds to look for a new cigarette in his cigar box. Once he finds one he taps it onto the lid and then puts it in his mouth while getting a match from the pocket of his vest that he lights at the bottom of his shoe and then tosses into the near garbage bin. After that he also tosses his gloves.  <br/> He looks around and sees an abandoned infant wrapped in blankets lying on the ground next to the garbage bins. He looks around as to find out if one of the people from the upper stories know anything about said child. As he picks it up a woman with a pram walks by in the background. Charly follows her and as she enters a building and leaves the pram with her own child unattended he places the infant in it and attempts to walk away. However, she reacts quite furiously and tells him to take out the baby and then proceeds to walk off in the other direction.  <br/> Charly though places the infant back on the ground where he first found him only to realize that there is a police officer standing right behind him. He then quickly picks up the baby again and walks away. He meets another man and pretends to have stepped into something. He hands over the baby to said man in order to clean off his shoe but then quickly runs back the way he came, leavin the baby with the other man.  <br/> Charly hides in a shed and the other man while looking for him sees the lady's pram and puts the baby in it. When leaving his hiding spot Charly again encounters the police officer which makes him change direction. He walks past the pram and the woman who again recognizes him and runs after him, hitting him with her umbrella. They walk back to the pram just as the police officer walks past. She continues to tell the officer about the child that clearly isn't hers and Charly ends up taking the child and walking off. He sits down onto the curb of the road and opens the gully as if thinking about putting the baby in there. Instead of doing so he finds a letter hidden between the baby's blankets that reads ""please love and care for this orphan child"". He puts the letter into his pocket, hugs the child tighter, laughs at him and then walks away with the baby in his arms."

seems to extinguish his cigarette so he needs to light a new cigarette and he gets a a new cigarette out of his pocket and then uh he discovers a baby laying on the floor bundled up in blankets and uh hhh he goes to see where it comes from ‘n’ he picks it up and is wondering where the baby came from ‘n’ then he sees uh a woman walking by with a baby carriage so it seems like he assumes that the baby must’ve come from her so he quickly runs up to her and puts the baby into the baby carriage uh and there’s already another baby inside of the baby carriage and uh then the woman uh comes back or sees that and she obviously seems to be uh angry about it or she it obviously isn’t her baby so she gives the baby back to Charlie hhh and she leaves and then uh Charlie doesn’t seem to know what else to do so he goes back to where he found the baby ‘n’ puts it back on the ground but then a police officer comes walking by and uh hhh so he is kind of so Charlie is kind of forced to pick the baby back up ‘n’ goes somewhere else and then uh he takes the baby ‘n’ walks around the corner where he sees an old man walking uh hhh so it seems like he asks the old man to hold the baby for a second when he tries to or pretends to tie his shoe uh hhh and then when the old man holds the baby Charlie quickly runs away ‘n’ hides in a garage uh hhh and so then the old man doesn’t really know what to do with baby so he walks around the corner and I think he sees the baby carriage or he sees a baby carriage in front of a store hhh and uh so he walks up to this baby carriage ‘n’ puts the baby inside of this baby carriage again uh and then the lady from before comes out of the store ‘n’ sees the baby but doesn’t know where it came from and meanwhile uh hhh Charlie came out of his uh hideout and sees the police officer again so he walks around the corner and is walking down the street where the old man had put the baby inside the baby carriage of the lady from before uh so the lady sees Charlie and thinks once again that he has put the baby into the baby carriage so she runs after him and drags him back ‘n’ starts to beat him with her umbrella and they start fighting or getting into an argument or discussing again uh hhh and so once again the police officer comes walking by and so when the lady uh starts to explain the situation to the police officer uh Charlie finally takes the baby ‘n’ walks away and again it seems like he doesn’t know what to do so he sits down on uh on the sidewalk and seems to uh think about what to do and  then there is a a sewer next to him and he opens the sewer and it seems like he is considering to put the baby into the sewer but then he closes it and takes another closer look at the baby and uh hhh then he seems to hurt his finger somewhere in the blankets of the baby and he finds a message between the blankets uh and the message is a piece of a paper and it says uh please take care please love ‘n’ care for this orphan child or something like that and so uh hhh that seems to change his mind and he takes a closer look at the baby and then finally starts smiling at it and t= talking to it and it seems like uh he has finally decided to uh yeah to be ok with it ‘n’ to take care of the baby so uh he takes it he stands up with the baby and walks away with it together		{'ok': 2, 'so': 20, 'in': 5, 'this': 5, 'videoclip': 1, 'uh': 32,

He takes out his walking stick and bends it a few times in his hands. While he is momentarily distracted, he gets hit by something that was being thrown out of a window, which causes him to drop his cigar. He then proceeds to take out his box of cigars and, after taking off his gloves, lightens another one with the sole of his shoe. After that he throws his gloves in a trash can. That is when he spots an abandoned baby lying behind another trash can. He picks it up and looks around to see who it might belong to and spots a woman with a pram. He hurries over to her and puts the baby in her pram. She gets angry and makes him understand that it isn't hers. He takes the baby out of the pram again and she scuttles away. He walks back to where he found the baby and puts it back down behind the trash can. However, when he realises that a police officer saw him doing so, he picks it back up and hurries away. Then he walks past an elderly man with a walking stick and tricks him into holding the baby while he pretends to tie his shoelaces and runs away. The elderly man hurries after him but can't find him. Instead, he sees a pram with another baby already in it, proceeds to put the baby in it, too, and walks away unnoticed. It turns out, the pram belongs to the woman from earlier, who recognises the baby. By chance, the protagonist walks past her in that moment, not noticing her or the baby. She runs after him and proceeds to beat him with her umbrella while dragging him back to the pram in order for him to take the baby back. The commotion attracts the police officer from earlier causing him to take the baby back and hurry away. Resigned, he sits down on the kerbside and holds the baby in his arm. That is when he finds a note in its blanket which reads ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". He looks at the baby, smiles at it, holds it closer and walks away."

He gets hit by trash falling down from a window above, which makes him lose his cigarette. Thus, he gets a new cigarette out of a metal tin from his pocket. Suddenly, he finds a crying baby on the dirty floor, bundled up in blankets. He looks around, wondering where it came from. He then picks it up and sees a lady with a baby carriage with another baby in it, walking by. Charlie assumes that the baby is probably hers, approaches her and puts the found baby in the baby carriage. The Lady seems outraged and they start arguing. Apparently it is not her baby so Charlie takes it out of the baby carriage, the lady leaves and he puts it back on the floor where he found it. But then a police officer comes walking by, so Charlie is forced to pick the baby back up. He walks around a corner where he sees an older man with a walking stick. Charlie hands him the baby, quickly runs away and hides in a garage. The older man finds the parked baby carriage from the lady from before, who seems to be in a store at that time, and like Charlie before he puts the baby into the carriage and walks away. Charlie comes out of his hideout and walks down the street where the lady comes out of the store. She sees the strange baby in her baby carriage and sees Charlie walking by. She gets very upset, runs after him and beats him with an umbrella, dragging him back to the baby carriage. They start discussing once more, the police officer comes by and as the lady starts to explain the situation, Charlie gives in and once againg takes the baby with him. Not knowing what else to do, he sits down on the sidewalk and for a second he considers putting the baby into the sewer. He then takes a closer look at the baby and, getting a papercut on his finger, he finds a note between the baby's blankets. It says ""Please love and care for this orphan child"", so Charlie takes another look at the baby, starts smiling and talking to it and it seems like he finally accepts to keep it. Together with the baby he stands up and walks away."

From a window aboth him, a person is throwing out trash , which the man barely avoids. He keeps on strolling down the street untill he is hit by another load of trash being falling from aboth. The man is upset and insults the culprit. Following this, the man pulls out another cigar from his tin. While lighting it, he notices a baby, lieing on the ground not far from him. As he picks up the child he sees a women with a babystroller walking by. He follows her and puts the baby next to the womens', but the women tells him off and he picks it back up. He puts the baby back on the floor where he found it, but a steern look from a nearby officer makes him quickly pick it up again and walk off. He meets a man witha long beard, gives him the baby to hold and then quickly runs of. The bearded man also sees the babystroller and puts the baby down while the mother is not there. After this the first man walks past the stroller aswell. The mother notices him and assumes it was him who put the baby down. She follows him and hits him with her umbrella. The man picks the baby up again and proceeds to sit down on sidewalk. He inspects the baby and finds a letter asking the reader to care for the orphan child. This makes the man walk off with the baby, now happy to take care of it.

Chaplin	written_online	22.0	Outside classroom		The four-minute long video, which is only accompanied by instrumental music and no voice acting, starts out on a construction site and focuses on a man wearing a suit and hat. After being hit by rubble twice and lighting a cigarette, he discovers a baby on the ground, wrapped in a blanket. Visibly puzzled, the man gazes around, trying to find out who the baby might belong to. He then picks it up and notices a woman pushing a stroller passing by. He places the baby into the stroller across from another baby, but takes it back after the woman gets mad at him. The man then decides to put the baby back on the ground where he found it, but changes his mind when he encounters a police officer. The man notices an old man with a walking cane and tricks him into holding the baby, whereupon the first man runs off. The old man puts the baby in the same stroller as the previous man and walks away. When the first man walks by the stroller, he gets beaten by the woman and gives in, taking back the baby. Finally, he sits down on the curb, discovers a note hidden in the baby's blanket saying that it is an orphan child. This causes the man to lovingly engage with the child and walk away.

Because he is scared that the baby is going to get hit by rubble that previously fell down on him, too, he picks it up, but does not really seem to know what to do with it. He then sees a woman with a pram and tries to put the child in there. The mother, however, of course notices that this is not her child and makes him take it out again, so Chaplin tries to lay it back down to where he found it, but is caught by a police officer, so he picks it up again. After running around trying to find somewhere to put the baby, he gives it to another man and quickly runs away. That man puts it in the woman's pram again and flees, too. When Chaplin walks past the woman after he was hiding somewhere, she thinks that it was him putting the baby back in there again and hits him with her umbrella until he takes the baby back. After Chaplin even debates leaving it in the drain, he finds a note on the child that states that this child is an orphan, and asks the finder to take care of it and love it. This is where he finally comes to terms with his fate and starts taking care of the baby.

He picks up the crying baby and tries to sneak it into a pram a mother left on the street while running errands. The mother notices and gets angry at Chaplin, who then has to take the baby back. He then tried to lay it back where he found it, but a police man catches him, so Chaplin has to take the baby again. He sees an old man and asks him to hold the baby so Chaplin can tie his shoes. The old man takes the baby and Chaplin runs away. Since the old man is not fast enough to catch him, he lays the baby into the first pram he can find, which is coincidentally the same pram in which Chaplin already has put the baby.  The angry mother thought Chaplin was at fault, found him and handed the baby back. Chaplin sits down on a curb and does not know what he should do with this baby. He even had a quick thought about dumping it in the sewage. Finally Chaplin starts searching in the cloth and blankets the baby is swaddled in and finds a note. The note says „ please love and care for this orphan child“.

Chaplin	written_online	26.0	Outside classroom		You can see Charly Chaplin walking down a street below a window. Another man is throwing bricks out of it. He walks past the bricks and is hit by some trash that fell from outside the shot. The line “Awkward ass” appears on a black screen. Chaplin takes out a new cigarette, takes of his gloves, ignites a match with his foot and lights the cigarette. He then throws his gloves in a bin. The next shot shows a crying baby on the floor. He takes a closer look at it and tries to find out where it might have come from by looking up. Chaplin takes up the child. In this moment a woman is walking by in background with a stroller. He walks to her and puts the baby down. The screen says “Pardon me, you dropped something”. The woman starts yelling at the man and he first attempts to take her child away, then his own. The woman furiously walks away. Chaplin then tries to lay the child back on the ground where it came from but a police officer is watching, so he decides to take it with him again. Next Chaplin encounters an old man. He acts like he has to tie his shoelaces and hands the child over to the old man. As soon as he is holding the baby Chaplin runs away. The old man follows him and finds the lady’s stroller. He puts the infant down and walks away. Then the woman returns to her child, only to find the other kid sitting in her stroller again. She sees Chaplin walking by and starts hitting him with her umbrella. She drags him back to the stroller and they argue about the situation. When the police officer returns Chaplin quickly decides to take the child away again. The next scene shows Chaplin and the child alone. They sit down on the street and Chaplin takes a look at the gutter next to him. He decides not to put the child down there and starts playing with it. He suddenly finds a note which he unfolds. It reads: Please love and care for this orphan child. Chaplin smiles at the baby while deciding to keep it. The last shot shows his feet walking away.		{'You': 1, 'can': 1, 'see': 1, 'Charly': 1, 'Chaplin': 11, 'walking': 4, 'down': 5, 'a': 13, 'street': 2, 'below': 1, 'window': 1, '.': 31, 'Another': 1, 'man': 5, 'is': 5, 'throwing': 1, 'bricks': 2, 'out': 3, 'of': 2, 'it': 7, 'He': 8, 'walks': 4, 'past': 1, 'the': 25, 'and': 14, 'hit': 1, 'by': 4, 'some': 1, 'trash': 1, 'that': 1, 'fell': 1, 'from': 3, 'outside': 1, 'shot': 3, 'The': 8, 'line': 1, '“': 2, 'Awkward': 1, 'ass': 1, '”': 2, 'appears': 1, 'on': 4, 'black': 1, 'screen': 2, 'takes': 5, 'new': 1, 'cigarette': 2, ',': 6, 'his': 6, 'gloves': 2, 'ignites': 1, 'match': 1, 'with': 5, 'foot': 1, 'lights': 1, 'then': 3, 'throws': 1, 'in': 3, 'bin': 1, 'next': 3, 'shows': 3, 'crying': 1, 'baby': 4, 'floor': 1, 'closer': 1, 'look': 2, 'at': 4, 'tries': 2, 'to': 14, 'find': 2, 'where': 2, 'might': 1, 'have': 1, 'come': 1, 'looking': 1, 'up': 2, 'child': 9, 'In': 1, 'this': 2, 'moment': 1, 'woman': 4, 'background': 1, 'stroller': 4, 'her': 5, 'puts': 2, 'says': 1, 'Pardon': 1, 'me': 1, 'you': 1, 'dropped': 1, 'something': 1, 'starts': 3, 'yelling': 1, 'he': 5, 'first': 1, 'attempts': 1, 'take': 3, 'away': 6, 'own': 1, 'furiously': 1, 'lay': 1, 'back': 2, 'ground': 1, 'came': 1, 'but': 1, 'police': 2, 'officer': 2, 'watching': 1, 'so': 1, 'decides': 3, 'him': 5, 'again': 3, 'Next': 1, 'encounters': 1, 'an': 1, 'old': 3, 'acts': 1, 'like': 1, 'has': 1, 'tie': 1, 'shoelaces': 1, 'hands': 1, 'over': 1, 'As': 1, 'soon': 1, 'as': 1, 'holding': 1, 'runs': 1, 'follows': 1, 'finds': 2, 'lady': 1, '’s': 1, 'infant': 1, 'Then': 1, 'returns': 2, 'only': 1, 'other': 1, 'kid': 1, 'sitting': 1, 'She': 2, 'sees': 1, 'hitting': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'drags': 1, 'they': 1, 'argue': 1, 'about': 1, 'situation': 1, 'When': 1, 'quickly': 1, 'scene': 1, 'alone': 1, 'They': 1, 'sit': 1, 'gutter': 1, 'not': 1, 'put': 1, 'there': 1, 'playing': 1, 'suddenly': 1, 'note': 1, 'which': 1, 'unfolds': 1, 'It': 1, 'reads': 1, ':': 1, 'Please': 1, 'love': 1, 'care': 1, 'for': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'smiles': 1, 'while': 1, 'deciding': 1, 'keep': 1, 'last': 1, 'feet': 1}	{'PRON': 47, 'AUX': 8, 'VERB': 76, 'PROPN': 14, 'ADP': 46, 'DET': 51, 'NOUN': 67, 'PUNCT': 42, 'CCONJ': 15, 'ADJ': 12, 'ADV': 27, 'PART': 11, 'SCONJ': 6, 'INTJ': 1}

Chaplin	written_online	30.0	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (German/English)	A man walks down a pathway. Suddenly, he gets hit by a pile of bricks. After shouting “Awkward ass” he lights up a cigarette. To light the cigarette up he takes off his gloves and throws them in a bin. When he wants to continue his walk he spots a baby which lies, just wrapped up in a blanket, on the pathway. As he thinks that a passing woman with a pram has just dropped the baby he runs to her and puts the baby back in the buggy. The woman becomes furious due to the unfamiliar child in her pram. The protagonist has no other option than taking the child with him again if he doesn’t want to get in a dispute with the woman.  <br/> As he decides to put the baby back to where he had found it a policeman appears behind him. Because he is being watched by the policeman he sees no other option than picking the baby up again and  walks away.  <br/> On his way he sees an old man and gives him the child, runs away and hides. The man, confused because he suddenly has an unfamiliar baby in his arms, seeks for a way to get rid of it as soon as possible.  <br/> When he sees a buggy, he puts the baby in it and goes away.  <br/> Meanwhile, the protagonist leaves the hiding place and runs across the policeman again. Because he doesn’t want to get into trouble with the man he goes away.  <br/> He comes across the woman with the buggy. The woman had already noticed the second baby in her stroller and assumes that the protagonist put the baby in there again. As she sees him passing she gets furious and hits him several times with her umbrella. She wants him to take the child. The policeman appears once again. The protagonist takes the baby and goes away.  <br/> The man, with the baby in his arm, sits down on the pavement and thinks about what he could do next to get rid of the baby. Then he sees a little piece of paper which is attached to the baby’s blanket. It says: “Please love and care for this orphan child.” When he reads that sentence his attitude towards the baby changes immediately and he begins to smile. He gets up and with the baby in his arms he leaves.		{'A': 1, 'man': 5, 'walks': 2, 'down': 2, 'a': 13, 'pathway': 2, '.': 26, 'Suddenly': 1, ',': 10, 'he': 23, 'gets': 3, 'hit': 1, 'by': 2, 'pile': 1, 'of': 4, 'bricks': 1, 'After': 1, 'shouting': 1, '“': 2, 'Awkward': 1, 'ass': 1, '”': 2, 'lights': 1, 'up': 5, 'cigarette': 2, 'To': 1, 'light': 1, 'the': 30, 'takes': 2, 'off': 1, 'his': 7, 'gloves': 1, 'and': 14, 'throws': 1, 'them': 1, 'in': 11, 'bin': 1, 'When': 3, 'wants': 2, 'to': 12, 'continue': 1, 'walk': 1, 'spots': 1, 'baby': 15, 'which': 2, 'lies': 1, 'just': 2, 'wrapped': 1, 'blanket': 2, 'on': 2, 'As': 3, 'thinks': 2, 'that': 3, 'passing': 2, 'woman': 5, 'with': 8, 'pram': 2, 'has': 3, 'dropped': 1, 'runs': 3, 'her': 4, 'puts': 2, 'back': 2, 'buggy': 3, 'The': 7, 'becomes': 1, 'furious': 2, 'due': 1, 'unfamiliar': 2, 'child': 5, 'protagonist': 4, 'no': 2, 'other': 2, 'option': 2, 'than': 2, 'taking': 1, 'him': 6, 'again': 5, 'if': 1, 'does': 2, 'n’t': 2, 'want': 2, 'get': 4, 'dispute': 1, ' ': 7, '<': 6, 'br/': 6, '>': 6, 'decides': 1, 'put': 2, 'where': 1, 'had': 2, 'found': 1, 'it': 3, 'policeman': 4, 'appears': 2, 'behind': 1, 'Because': 2, 'is': 2, 'being': 1, 'watched': 1, 'sees': 5, 'picking': 1, 'away': 5, 'On': 1, 'way': 2, 'an': 2, 'old': 1, 'gives': 1, 'hides': 1, 'confused': 1, 'because': 1, 'suddenly': 1, 'arms': 2, 'seeks': 1, 'for': 2, 'rid': 2, 'as': 2, 'soon': 1, 'possible': 1, 'goes': 3, 'Meanwhile': 1, 'leaves': 2, 'hiding': 1, 'place': 1, 'across': 2, 'into': 1, 'trouble': 1, 'He': 2, 'comes': 1, 'already': 1, 'noticed': 1, 'second': 1, 'stroller': 1, 'assumes': 1, 'there': 1, 'she': 2, 'hits': 1, 'several': 1, 'times': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'She': 1, 'take': 1, 'once': 1, 'arm': 1, 'sits': 1, 'pavement': 1, 'about': 1, 'what': 1, 'could': 1, 'do': 1, 'next': 1, 'Then': 1, 'little': 1, 'piece': 1, 'paper': 1, 'attached': 1, '’s': 1, 'It': 1, 'says': 1, ':': 1, 'Please': 1, 'love': 1, 'care': 1, 'this': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'reads': 1, 'sentence': 1, 'attitude': 1, 'towards': 1, 'changes': 1, 'immediately': 1, 'begins': 1, 'smile': 1}	{'DET': 56, 'NOUN': 75, 'VERB': 74, 'ADP': 52, 'PUNCT': 41, 'ADV': 26, 'PRON': 54, 'AUX': 13, 'PROPN': 6, 'PART': 12, 'CCONJ': 14, 'SCONJ': 13, 'ADJ': 11, 'SPACE': 7, 'X': 12, 'INTJ': 1}

He takes a cigarette out of a small tin and lightens it with the help of a match and the sole of his shoe. He then bins his dirty gloves, looks around and finds a crying baby, wrapped in rugs, lying on the ground. He picks the baby up and looks around to see where the baby might have came from. He then sees a woman passing by with a baby carriage with another child in it. As he thinks she has lost the baby he has found he puts the baby into the baby carriage as well. This makes the woman very angry with him, as it is apparently not her child, so the man takes it out again and lies it back to where he has found it. When he turns around, though, a policeman is watching him, so again he picks up the child and walks away. Around the next corner he sees an old man whom he gives the child, deliberately only to do up his laces, but actually he is trying to get rid of the baby and runs away. The old man tries to follow him but cannot find him. Instead he comes by the baby carriage from earlier and, as the mother has left it unattended for a moment, puts the abandoned baby in it and runs away. When the woman comes back to the baby carriage and finds the second baby in it again, she looks around the street and sees the first man (coincidently) walking by. She runs after him, hits on him with her umbrella and drags him back to the baby carriage, where they argue. This is when the policeman comes to see what has happened, so the man takes the baby again and walks away with it. He sits down with the baby on the street, shortly thinking about getting rid of it in the canalisation, but deciding against it. As he looks at the baby alittle closer he finds a note hidden inside the baby's rugs saying ""Please love and care for this orphan child. Having pity with the baby, he smiles at it and takes it home with him."

After brushing it off, he lights a cigar just to find a baby lying next to a trashcan. He sees a woman with a baby carriage walking past, and thinks that it has to be her baby. He puts the baby in the carriage and says to her ""You dropped something"". But she insists that it is not her baby, and demands that he takes it back. After reluctantly taking it back, he decides to put the baby where he found it. After realizing that he is being watched by a policeman, he walks off with the baby and crams it into the arms of an elderly man. This man puts the baby into the woman's baby carriage again. When she realizes the strange baby is back in her carriage, she beats up Charlie Chaplin, who was just walking past her at that moment. The policeman reappears, and the woman demands that Charlie Chaplin takes the baby back. After doing so, he  walks through the alleys and ultimately sits down on the pavement. For a moment, he considers putting the baby into a hole leading to the sewage system, but does not act on it. Then he finds a piece of paper in the baby's cloth, which says the baby is an orphan and needs love and care. He walks off with the baby, and it seems like he has decided to keep it."

Chaplin	written_online	35.0	Outside classroom		Chaplin is walking down an alley and gets hit with trash that is thrown out of the window. As he is looking around himself, he takes a small metal box out of his coat and lights a cigarette. He throws away his gloves and looking down on the ground, he sees a baby that is crying and all wrapped up in a blanket. Chaplin once again looks around as if the child fell from heaven (or even out of the window like the trash earlier) and finally picks it up. He doesn't know what to do with the kid so as he sees a lady with a pram, he thinks it may be her child and puts the baby back in the buggy. The lady seems to be upset and tells him to take the baby back, which he eventually does. Chaplin decides to put the baby back where he found it and an officer appears which leads him to pick the baby up again. As he walks past an old man, he shows him that he has to tie his shoe laces and asks the man to hold his baby and puts it in his arms. Chaplin pretends to tie his laces but runs off and the old man follows him. Chaplin hides and as the man doesn't find him anymore, he puts the baby in the pram of the woman we saw earlier. Chaplin walks past her and she follows him and hits her with an umbrella. She then wants him to take the baby back which he eventually does once the officer is back as well. He leaves and sits down with the baby in his lap. Chaplin seems to think about just putting the child in the sewer but realizes that he can't do it. He then takes a closer look and finds a piece of paper inside the blanket which states that the child is an orphan. Chaplin smiles at the baby and leaves with him.

Chaplin	written_online	10.0	Outside classroom		The video shows a short Chaplin sketch in which Chaplin finds an apparently abandoned baby and chaos ensues. Charles Chaplin takes a walk through the dirty back alleys of a city. After lighting a cigarette for himself, he encounters a crying baby hidden behind trash cans. He picks it up and, while looking around for the mother, sees a woman passing by with a stroller. He follows the woman, thinking it might be the baby's mother. But the baby does not appear to belong to the woman, as she starts to complain and argue after Charles put the baby in the stroller, next to another infant. He then proceeds to pick up the baby again, only to be followed by a police officer who observes Charles putting the baby back on the ground by the trash cans where he initially found it. After receiving a stern look from the police officer, Charles picks up the baby again and turns to leave. He next tries to hand the baby over to a random stranger by pretending to tie his shoes while the man holds the baby. But when he runs off, he is followed by the other man. The baby ends up again in the stroller of the same woman as before. Meanwhile, Charles walks into the police officer again who appears to find it suspicious that Charles is no longer carrying a baby. Charles walks away, passes the woman in the street, who by now has found a second infant in her stroller again, and she stops him and beats him with her umbrella, thinking he put the baby there again. A heated discussions ensures, just in time for the police officer to make another appearance. Charles is stuck with the unknown baby again. He briefly considers dropping the baby into a sewer, but decides against it and ends up sitting on the curb with the baby in his lap. Upon closer inspection, he finds a note which implores the finder to please take care of the orphaned baby. The video ends with Charles walking off while cradling the baby in his arms.

After narrowly avoiding being covered in garbage thrown out of windows, and after lighting a cigarrette, Chaplin finds an orphaned baby lying next to a garbage can. He picks it up and decides to return it. A mother walks by, pushing her own baby in a baby carriage. Chaplin slips the orphan into the carriage next to the other baby, but the mother notices and protests until Chaplin takes back the orphan. Discouraged, Chaplin plans to place the baby back next to the garbage can where he found it. A stern-looking police officer observes him, which causes Chaplin to change his mind and keep walking with the baby. Around the corner, he sees another passer-by and hands him the orphan. Chaplin runs off and hides, and the confused passer-by, seeking to get rid of the orphan as well, places the baby in the mother's baby carriage. Chaplin, who is now convinced that the matter is resolved, happens to walk by the baby carriage, and the mother suspects him of having slipped the orphan into her carriage a second time. The police officer joins the altercation, and the mother protests to the officer, so that poor Chaplin is forced to take back the orphan yet again. Exhausted, Chaplin sits down on the curb with the orphan in his arm. He finds a note which asks the person who finds the orphan to take loving care of the baby. Chaplin smiles affectionately and appears to accept that responsibility. He stands up, with the baby still in his arms, and walks off scene."

Chaplin	written_online	10.0	Outside classroom		Walking through an alley, getting thrown at with various objects from windows, an annoyed Chaplin lights a chigarette next to some bins at the end of the alley. Laying there he finds a baby, wrapped in sheets with a scarf around their head. He picks it up and while looking at the baby a woman with a stroller walks past towards one of the entrances in the back of the alley. When Chaplin sees her, he tries giving back the baby, assuming she dropped it by accident. She demands him to take it out of the stroller, where he previously placed it. Chaplin does so, and brings the baby back to where he found it next to the bins. A police-officer observes the action and when Chaplin notices the officer, he quickly picks the baby off of the ground and into in his arms again and walks back through the alley, where he came from in the beginning. Around the corner a man is walking and Chaplin approaches him, gets him to hold the baby under the pretence of tying his shoelace and while the man is engrossed in looking at the baby, Chaplin flees back around the corner, abandoning child and man. The now confused man brings the baby to what I assume to be a shop, where he sees a child inside a stroller and places the baby inside it as well, before running away as Chaplin did before. A woman exits the doorway and sees the two children in the stroller, one of which is only hers, obviously. Just as she does, Chaplin walks past, she hurries after him, yelling at him while catching up. It is the same woman, that he already tried to give the child to before in the alley. She hits him multiple times with her umbrella and drags him back to the stroller, having him take the baby out again. He refuses, but when the same officer comes back and the woman tries to engage him in the argument, Chaplin takes the baby and leaves. He sits down on the curb with the child in his arms and contemplates dropping it in the sewer for a second. But he decides agains it. He takes away the sheets from the child’s neck and notices a piece of paper on which is written a plea to take care of the child, which apparently is orphaned.

He tries to get rid of the baby by putting it into a baby carriage of a woman passing by. The lady is furious with him and he takes the baby and tries to put it back, where he found it, but a policeman who happened to pass by, watches him and he is obligated to pick the baby back up. Next Chaplin tries to dispose of the child by pretending to have to tie his shoelace, putting the baby into the arms of a passerby, and taking off quickly. The stranger who is now stranded with the baby encounters the same baby carriage, as Chaplin has before and puts the child in there. Meanwhile, Chaplin steps out of a shed he had hid in and almost runs into the same policeman again, so he takes off as fast as he can. Suddenly, the woman, who had parked the baby carriage in front of a store, steps out and sees Chaplin walking by, presuming he tried to get rid of the baby again by putting it into her baby carriage. Furiously, she runs after him, beating him with an umbrella. At the same time, the policeman is coming around the corner and also starts berating Chaplin, who again picks up the child and walks on. Exhausted he sits down on the curb and contemplates sticking the baby into the street drain. But as he looked closer at the baby, he finds a note asking to "" love and care for this orphan child.""

Picking the apparently abandoned baby up, Chaplin is trying to figure out what to do when he sees a lady with a stroller passing by. Assuming that she is the mother of the child, he runs after her and, when she turns around, places the baby in the stroller. However, the lady notices and in a displeased manner makes Chaplin understand that the baby is not, in fact, hers, as her own baby is already sitting in the stroller. He is therefore obliged to take the child back. Deciding to bring it back to where he found it, he is caught by a policeman right when he tries to put the baby down next to the trash can. Next, he hands it over to another man while pretending to have to fix his shoe and then runs off. The other man chases after him, yet cannot find him and decides to place the baby in the very same stroller Chaplin had put it in before and which is now standing in front of a shop entrance. The lady, leaving the shop and seeing two babies in her stroller, recognizes Chaplin as he walks by (by accident) and the two enter into a heated discussion. In the middle of their argument, the police officer that Chaplin had encountered before walks by and joins them. Chaplin is, therefore, once again, forced to take the baby with him. He sits down on the boardwalk next to a gully top and takes off the top, obviously contemplating to drop the baby in there. On lifting the child up, he discovers a piece of paper, reading ""please love and care for this orphan child"". He looks at the baby again, his facial expression changing, and apparently has a change of heart: smiling at the child, he lifts it up and walks away holding it in his arms."

After lighting another using the sole of his shoe, he throws away his gloves and turns to discover an abandoned infant on the ground. In search of their guardian, he picks up the child and sees a woman walking by. He attempts to drop the baby in her pram only to be turned away, and picks up the woman's own child first before retrieving the lost one. As he returns to the alley to put the baby back where he found it, a policeman positions himself behind him, upon whose discovery he recovers the child. Turning a corner, he happens upon another man to whom he hands the bundle. In his escape, he is pursued by the old man, who places the baby in a pram standing in front of a shop. Just as the mother leaves the building, Chaplin walks past and she beats him with an umbrella. While she drags him back to the baby, the policeman arrives at the scene and Chaplin is forced to take the child back. He sits down on the curb and considers leaving it in the gutter for a short time, but ultimately lets the lid fall shut.

Some of the garbage hits his cigar which causes him to light up a new one. As he throws away his worn down gloves, he notices a baby on the floor next to garbage bin and picks it up. While he wonders where it came from, a mother is passing and he puts the child into her pram, thinking that it must be hers. Since he is mistaken she starts protesting and thus Chaplin attempts to return the baby to where he found it. However, he is caught by a police officer and is forced to pick the baby up again. Then he tries to trick a passer-by into holding the baby and runs into hiding. The man follows him but can only find the woman's pram where he leaves the baby. Chaplin comes out of hiding and walks away but the woman, who has already noticed the baby in her pram, sees him and starts beating him with her umbrella. Again, the police officer arrives and Chaplin has to run off with the baby. In another street, he drops his cane and has to sit down to pick it up. For a moment he considers dropping it into the sewers but then takes a closer look at the child. He finds a note that asks the finder to care for the child since it is an orphan. In the end, Chaplin gets up again and decides to take the baby with him.

He picks it up, seems confused and then notices a lady walk past, with a baby in a pram. The lady leaves her push chair outside a shop and Charles Chaplin sneakily sits the child in the push chair next to the lady's baby. He gets told off by the woman and they have  massive row. Charles Chaplin takes the baby, lays it back in the corner, gets caught and chased by a police officer and hands the child to a homeless person who then has the same idea as Chaplin, namely putting the baby back in the woman's pram. The lady sees Charles Chaplin potter along and holds him responsible. She yells at him and gives him the baby. After sitting down with the little one on his lap, Charles finds a note on the baby which states that it's an orphan.

Just as he attempts to light a cigar, he sees a baby wrapped up in a blanket, lying on the ground next to a metal container.  <br/> He picks the baby up and attempts to find out where it came from and how it got there. As he turns around he sees a woman with a child sitting in a pram and figures that the baby must belong to her. He puts it into the pram, but the woman insists that the baby is not hers. <br/> Chaplin then takes the child back and goes to put it back down where he found it. However, he is interrupted by a police officer patrolling in the neighbourhood, so he quickly picks the baby back up and leaves. <br/> Just as he rounds the corner he sees an elderly man and gives the baby to him, pretending to tie his shoelaces before running the other way. The elderly man attempts to run after him, but instead spots the same pram Chaplin put the baby into before. The man repeats Chaplin's previous action and leaves as well. <br/> In that moment, the protagonist comes out of hiding and happens to pass that same pram. The woman Chaplin met earlier spots him and beats him with an umbrella, thinking that it was him who put the baby back. They argue and as the same police officer form earlier joins them Chaplin takes the child out of the pram. <br/> Defeated, he sits down on the pavement. As he touches the baby's blanket he feels the hard edge of a note and takes it out. It says: ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". Chaplin's heart seems to melt reading this and so he accepts his new role as adoptive father, gets up and leaves with the child in his arms."

Just as he is about to walk through a narrow alley more rubbish is thrown out of a window above him which just so happens to hit him as he walks by. He stops and just as he lights himself a cigar he sees a crying baby laying next to a rubbish can. Chaplin picks up the baby and spots a woman with a pram. While the woman disappears he puts the baby into the pram. However, the woman quickly returns and angrily tells him to take back the baby as it is not hers. In the process of following her request, Chaplin almost picks up the wrong baby. After the encounter with the woman he attempts to put the baby back where he found it but is spotted by a policeman and quickly picks the child back up. Being back where he started Chaplin walks along the road with the baby in his arms when he spots an elderly gentleman. He hands him the baby, pretending to have to tie his shoelaces and runs away. The elderly man follows Chaplin but is unable to find him, as he hides in a doorway. As Chaplin before, the man spots a pram and puts the baby in it before walking away. The woman from his earlier encounter approaches the pram, spots the baby before seeing Chaplin walk by and begins beating him with an umbrella dragging him back to the pram. The policeman appears again and Chaplin quickly picks up the baby again and leaves. He sits down with the baby on the pavement, contemplating for a moment whether to drop it into a drain. After discarding the thought he finds a note on the baby asking him to ""please love and care for this orphan child"". Chaplin's heart visibly softens. He smiles at the baby and, after wrapping his arms around it tightly, gets up and walks away with the baby."

He dodges some garbage being thrown out of a window but shortly after entering an alley way he is hit by another load of what looks like food scraps. It looks like in the process he lost his cigarette and so he takes another out of a metal box containing cigarettes and cigars. After taking off his gloves he lights a match by scraping it across the sole of his shoe, lights his cigarette and then throws both the match and his gloves away. Shortly after, the man notices a baby on the ground next to some garbage cans and, after apparently looking around in the air for the origin of the baby picks it up. In the background a woman pushing a pram can be seen walking by. The man turns around and while the woman isn't looking deposits the baby next to the woman's baby that is already inside the pram. The woman returns and the man tells her that she dropped something. She is not impressed by this and demands that he take the baby away again. After first trying to take the wrong baby, the man takes the correct baby to the place where he found it. Turning around, he comes face to face with a police officer and immediately turns around to pick the baby back up again and walks away with it in his arms. Next, he tries to give the baby to an older man walking down a street with a cane by pretending that he has to tie his shoe and after the older man has the baby in his arms he runs away and hides. The older man follows him and comes across the pram of the same women seen earlier. He deposits the baby into the pram and walks away. The man comes out from his hiding place and walks past the woman and her pram again, who has discovered that the same baby has been pushed onto her again. She sees the man walk past and beats him up with her umbrella, dragging him back to the baby by the scruff of his neck and demanding that he take it back. The police officer can be seen approaching and the woman seems to accuse the man, who takes the baby back and sits down on a curb with it. He seems to contemplate putting the baby inside of a street drain, but decides against it. After searching the babies clothes he finds a note saying ""Please love and care for this orphan child"".

As he moves towards the camera, more garbage is dropped from a different window and hits Chaplin on the head. He dusts off his jacket and continues on his way. He stops to retrieve a cigarette butt from a tin in his pocket, takes off his gloves, lights the cigarette, and throws his gloves away. Next to the garbage can, he discovers a baby wrapped in a blanket. He looks up and around, and picks it up. When a woman with a stroller walks by, he quickly follows her to return the lost baby to her. She stops and he places the baby inside her stroller. The baby does not seem to belong to the woman and she gets upset. She sends Chaplin away and he returns to the same spot where the baby was found. When he is about to put it back on the ground, a police officer suddenly appears behind him. Chaplin picks the baby back up and leaves the scene. He stops an old man on the street, asks him to hold the baby, and runs off. The old man tries to follow him but Chaplin is faster and manages to hide. The old man discovers the same stroller from earlier parked outside a shop and places the baby inside it. As the woman comes out of the shop and discovers the strange baby in her stroller, Chaplin walks by and she runs after him. She takes her umbrella, knocks him to the ground, and drags him back to her stroller. The two of them begin to argue and are joined by the police officer. Chaplin takes back the baby and leaves. He sits down on the curb, next to a sewer grate, and opens it, looking at the baby as though he is considering to drop it into the sewer. He quickly changes is mind and closes the grate again.

He took off his gloves so it could be easier to light that cigar up with a match and, on a sudden, since he didn't know what to do with his gloves, he threw it on a bin next to him. Right after that, he found a baby lying on the ground crying out loud. He thought that baby belonged to a woman with a baby carriage, but he was wrong and she got really mad. He tried to leave it on the ground again but the police caught him. He handed it to an old man and, surprisingly, that baby got back to the woman that appeared before and back again to Chaplin. Giving up, he sat on the floor with that baby and found a note within his/her blankets: Please, love and care this orphan baby. This note melted Chaplin's heart so he decided to take care of the baby.

The baby was covered inside some cloths and Chaplin didn't know about to do about him. Then, he saw a mother with his child far away, and he wondered that maybe she was also the mother of the child he found, so he gave the child to the woman saying that it was hers. <br/> The woman refused to take care of that baybe since it wasn't hers, so she shouted to Chaplin telling him not to bother her anymore, so Chaplin decided to place the child right where he found him. As he was doing that, a police man who was patrolling around the area stared at Chaplin with a serious look, so Chaplin wasn't able to leave the child where he found him. <br/> Therefore, he started walking around far away from the police man, trying to look for somebody that could take care of that little baby, and then he found another old man around there that could be his perfect target. Chaplin asked the old man If he could take care of the baby for a second, and the right moment he gave him the little boy he started to run away as fast as he could. <br/> However, the old man managed to get rid off the little baby by leaving him in the baby  cart of the mother previously mentioned, and then he also run away. When the mother found that child once again in her baby cart, she thought that it was Chaplin who did that, so as soon as she saw him again she started to beat him with her lady bag with no mercy. Moreover, the police man appeared once again in the scenario while the woman was complaining about Chaplin, so finally Chaplin had to admit his lose and take care of the child. <br/> At the end of the video, we can see how Chaplin thought for a moment to throw the little child into the sewer, but then he regreted it. Then, he took a loot at the baby's cloths and he found a little paper that had the following message written down: ""Take care of this precious child"", and then he decided to take care of him and he suddenly was happy again."

His movies aside from spending a good time laughing, they have several subliminal messages about what society is like. <br/> In my opinion Chaplin is the best  comedic actor in the silenc film.		{'The': 2, 'Chaplin': 3, 'video': 1, 'is': 3, 'very': 1, 'emotival': 1, ',': 2, 'because': 1, ' ': 2, 'It': 1, 'makes': 1, 'us': 1, 'think': 1, 'about': 2, 'the': 4, 'abandonment': 1, 'of': 3, 'children': 1, 'that': 3, 'were': 2, 'in': 3, '60s': 1, '.': 5, '  ': 1, '<': 2, 'br/': 2, '>': 2, 'movies': 2, 'a': 2, 'great': 1, 'invention': 1, 'which': 1, 'I': 1, 'took': 1, 'advantage': 1, 'to': 1, 'make': 1, 'an': 1, 'attempt': 1, 'social': 1, 'conscience': 1, 'his': 1, 'films': 1, 'denounced': 1, 'several': 2, 'injustices': 1, 'existed': 1, 'at': 1, 'time': 2, 'His': 1, 'aside': 1, 'from': 1, 'spending': 1, 'good': 1, 'laughing': 1, 'they': 1, 'have': 1, 'subliminal': 1, 'messages': 1, 'what': 1, 'society': 1, 'like': 1, 'In': 1, 'my': 1, 'opinion': 1, 'best': 1, 'comedic': 1, 'actor': 1, 'silenc': 1, 'film': 1}	{'DET': 10, 'PROPN': 3, 'NOUN': 21, 'AUX': 5, 'ADV': 2, 'ADJ': 9, 'PUNCT': 7, 'SCONJ': 1, 'SPACE': 3, 'PRON': 11, 'VERB': 9, 'ADP': 12, 'X': 5, 'PART': 1}

At the same moment he saw a woman carrying a trolly, so he thought that maybe she had missed him there. He tried to gave her the baby but she refused him. Then, the man got back to the rubbish and put him there again. But then, a police thought that he was leaving a baby alone, and he turned so angry. The man decided to toke the baby again and he gave it to an old man. The old man was so confused and when he saw a trolly, he put him in again. But the woman, the owner's trolly, didn't see the old man: She saw again the man of the beggining! She was so angry. She catched the man up and gave him the baby again.  <br/> The man didn't know what to do. He sat down on the pavement, and when he was looking the baby, he discovered a note between his clothes.

People are throwing rubbish out of their windows, and Mr. Chaplin gets hit twice by the falling rubbish. All of a sudden, he realises that there is something more than rubbish laying on the floor; there is an abandoned child. Confused, Mr. Chaplin, looks around to see if he can find the child's parents. When a lady who is carrying a pushchair  passes by, he assumes that the lady had lost or abandoned the child. When he hands the baby over to the lady, the lady reacts furiously, as the baby is not hers.  <br/>  <br/> Disappointed, Mr. Chaplin decices to leave the baby back where it was, when he walks into a police officer, who stares at him when he sees Mr. Chaplin leaving a baby on the streets. Having changed his mind due to the presence of the angry-looking officer, he hands the baby to an anonymous man who he sees in a nearby street. The anonymous man then sees the lady with the pushchair and decides to leave the baby in it and run away. However, when the lady sees Mr. Chaplin again, she hands the baby back to him.  <br/>  <br/> This humorous short clip ends on a good note, as Mr. Chaplin reads a note that explains that the baby is an orphan needy of care and love, and decides to take care of him.

In this one, Chaplin is walking down the street, which is in very bad conditions, and suddenly finds a baby laying on the floor and he decides to hold him so he can see if someone left it there for some reason but he finally realizes that someone has abandoned him so he tries to give it to a mother who also has another baby. She gets really angry with Chaplin and doesn't accept the baby so Chaplin decides to bring the baby back to the place where he found him. When he finally gets rid of the baby he finds out that there's a policeman right behind him, so he has to take the baby again and bring it with him. This time he tries to cheat a man by giving him the baby so he can tie his shoelaces and when the man is not looking he starts running. The man started chasing Chaplin to give him his baby back but he couldn't reach him so, this man decides to give the baby to the same woman but this time he left him on the baby cart while she was not paying attention. Then, Chaplin casually went through that same street because he was being chased by the policeman since he didn't have the baby with him, so when this woman saw Chaplin, she started to kick him with an umbrella and Chapin finally took the baby with him since he didn't have another choice. Then, he sat on the sidewalk and saw that the baby had a note with him asking for love and care because he was an orphan so Chaplin finally decided to take the baby with him.

Later this man encounters a woman who has a baby and believes that the other baby he has found can also be her baby but it turns out that this is not so. Therefore he leaves the baby where he found him without realizing that a police was watching him. When he turns around he discovers the police, so he takes the baby back in his arms and takes him to the other side where he sees another man who asks for help to support the baby, once he has it, he runs away. The man with the baby does not know what to do, but suddenly he sees a baby carriage with another baby inside and he decides to introduce the baby of his arms also and then he goes. Resulting that the baby stroller in which the man deposits the baby belong to the woman mentioned and when she crosses again with the  protagonist man accuses him to the police of having left the baby under his charge so he has no more option that taking the baby back with him. Finally, he finds a note in which someone writes that whoever finds the baby will take care of him and give him a lot of love so that is what the man decides to do.		{'In': 1, 'the': 19, 'following': 1, 'story': 1, 'appears': 1, 'a': 8, 'somewhat': 1, 'clueless': 1, 'man': 7, 'who': 3, 'casually': 1, 'finds': 3, 'baby': 16, '.': 7, 'Later': 1, 'this': 2, 'encounters': 1, 'woman': 2, 'has': 4, 'and': 6, 'believes': 1, 'that': 7, 'other': 2, 'he': 14, 'found': 2, 'can': 1, 'also': 2, 'be': 1, 'her': 1, 'but': 2, 'it': 2, 'turns': 2, 'out': 1, 'is': 2, 'not': 2, 'so': 4, 'Therefore': 1, 'leaves': 1, 'where': 2, 'him': 7, 'without': 1, 'realizing': 1, 'police': 3, 'was': 1, 'watching': 1, 'When': 1, 'around': 1, 'discovers': 1, ',': 5, 'takes': 2, 'back': 2, 'in': 3, 'his': 3, 'arms': 2, 'to': 7, 'side': 1, 'sees': 2, 'another': 2, 'asks': 1, 'for': 1, 'help': 1, 'support': 1, 'once': 1, 'runs': 1, 'away': 1, 'The': 1, 'with': 4, 'does': 1, 'know': 1, 'what': 2, 'do': 2, 'suddenly': 1, 'carriage': 1, 'inside': 1, 'decides': 2, 'introduce': 1, 'of': 4, 'then': 1, 'goes': 1, 'Resulting': 1, 'stroller': 1, 'which': 2, 'deposits': 1, 'belong': 1, 'mentioned': 1, 'when': 1, 'she': 1, 'crosses': 1, 'again': 1, ' ': 1, 'protagonist': 1, 'accuses': 1, 'having': 1, 'left': 1, 'under': 1, 'charge': 1, 'no': 1, 'more': 1, 'option': 1, 'taking': 1, 'Finally': 1, 'note': 1, 'someone': 1, 'writes': 1, 'whoever': 1, 'will': 1, 'take': 1, 'care': 1, 'give': 1, 'lot': 1, 'love': 1}	{'ADP': 20, 'DET': 32, 'VERB': 43, 'NOUN': 41, 'ADV': 16, 'ADJ': 5, 'PRON': 39, 'PUNCT': 12, 'CCONJ': 8, 'SCONJ': 13, 'AUX': 9, 'PART': 6, 'SPACE': 1}

While an English man is walking around the town, there were people working in the buildings, throwing from the window some bullshit that drops into this English man. He continued walking, but when he was going to smoke a cigarrette, he found a litlle boy crying in the street.  <br/> He decided to take him and tried to look for the baby's family. Sudently he saw a woman carrying on a baby, he asked her if the baby is hers, but it wasn't. <br/> He kept on trying to find his family but it had no result. So he thought to give the baby to a stranger was the best option. Ironically this stranger found the same woman that the English man met before and he put the baby in her trolley with her daughter. When the woman found the baby again in her trolley, the English man was walking around the same street, so she thought he was doing again the same thing than before. She lashed him and also told the police what happened. Now the baby is again with the English man and, after trying everything to find the family of the baby,  he finally decided to take care of him.

It was a baby crying on the floor. A woman with her baby was passing by at that moment so Charles thinks is hers. The lady, upset, gives the baby back to him. As he doesn't know what to do with the child, Charles leaves the baby on the floor, where he found him but a policeman arrives and Chaplin takes the baby again. He manages to give the baby to a man who was walking on the street and this man finds the woman who Charles found at the begining with the baby.  The man drops the baby with that woman but unfortunately Chaplin was passing by at that moment so they begin a fight. Finally Charles finds a note which says that the baby is an orphan, so he decides to take that baby as it was his.

He takes one and put it in his mouth and take his glove off. Then, he lights a cigarette. He hears a noise and realises that there is a baby crying over the floor. He takes him and starts to look for someone. At the same time, a lady appears behind him carrying a baby cart, the lady goes upstairs and he leaves the baby in the cart. The lady appears again, she looks very upset and tells him that she is not the responsible of the baby, he is not hers. He tries to get rid of  the baby, leaving him in the same place where he found him but in that moment, a sheriff comes up and he has to lift the baby again. He starts to walk looking for a place to leave the baby without being seen. He finds an old man, gives the baby to him and runs, hiding him from the man. This one finds the baby cart's woman on his way and leaves the baby on it. The lady finds the baby in her cart again. Chaplin is passing by there at that point and she runs behind him and starts to beat him with an umbrella. The policeman is walking around there again and she blames Chaplin for the baby. He takes the baby and looks, desperately, for a place to leave him. He finds a drain on the floor and thinks about putting him inside, but finally, he feels sorry for the baby and does not do it. At the end of the video, Chaplin finds a note in the baby's clothes that says: take care and love this orphan child. He smiles and goes back home carrying the baby.

As a result of that meeting, he tries to leave the baby to anyone who is on the streets because he doesn't want to be responsible for him. For example, he tries to give him to a woman that has a cart in which there's already a baby or to a vagabond who is having a walk quietly. It is also interesting the fact that he meets a policeman everytime he gives the child to someone and the policeman thinks the baby is from Chaplin and that he wants to leave him. Despite all the attempts, the baby in one way or another returns to Chaplin's arms and he finds a note that was in the baby's clothes. The note explains that the people that has left the child wants him to be treated with love. This note convinces Chaplin and he decides to take care of him.

Suddenly he discovers an abandoned baby in the floor next to the garbage and he takes it. At the same time a woman carrying a baby trolley appears in the scene, and so, Chaplin thinks that the baby should be hers. <br/>  <br/> When he insinuates her that she should have lost it she get angry and in a bad way tells him to get away. After this, Chaplin goes to leave the baby in the same place where he has found it but the appearence of a policeman dissudades him and takes it again. <br/>  <br/> With the baby in his arms, Chaplin doesn't know what to do with it, till he finds the way to stuck it to a poor man and run away. This poor man, also, doesn't know what to do with it and, suddenly, he founds out a baby trolley in the street so he places it inside and run. However, the owner of the trolley appears, who is the woman appearing before, and by coincidence, Chaplin is wandering around. Thus, the woman thinks that the same man has tried to cheat her twice. She starts shouting and so, Chaplin has to take the baby with him again. <br/>  <br/> At the end, alone with the baby, he finds a message in baby's clothes begging to love and care for the orphaned child. This way, it seems that Chaplins decides to take care of it and they go together.

He’s confused and trying to understand what happened or who through that over him. <br/> He takes a metal box where his cigarettes are and choses one, but he takes off his gloves to light up the cigarettes. What's more, when he throwing away his gloves, he finds a little baby. The baby is crying and Charles is searching for someone but there's nobody there. Charles holds the child and, from somewhere, appears a woman with a baby carriage with another boy in it. He starts to follow her, he catches her and puts the baby into the baby carriage. Instantly, the woman sees him and starts yelling at him. In the screen appears what Charles says to her: ‘Pardon me, you dropped something.’ However, the woman shouts at him to take away the baby and he runs away holding him. <br/> In the next scenes he decides to let the baby in the floor again, nevertheless an officer appears, so he has to runs again with the baby in his arms. Then he finds an old man and he leave the kid with him. When the man holds the baby, Charles starts to run again and he hides so the old man cannot return him the kid. The old man tries to find him, but instead, he finds the baby carriage, which appeared in the other scene, and puts the baby into it. Finally, Charles get out of his hiding place but the officer appears again, and runs. We see how other people across the same street as the baby carriage is, but when is Charles’s turn, the woman see him again, catch him and starts to hit him.

He does things that ordinary people wouldn't do. For instance, to a light a cigarette with a shoe. While he's smoking this cigarette, he finds a kid abandoned. He doesn't know what to do and he starts looking everywhere to guess who is the mother but he doesn't find an answer. The only thing he knows is that he doesn't want to take care of him; so he tries to find a person to do it but he doesn't have success. He even tries to leave him where he found him, but a policeman sees him doing it, so he doesn't have any other option and keeps on looking for a person to take care of him.

Chaplin was walking through the street happily and smoking when suddenly pieces of buildings were falling. However, this is not the most surprising thing that happened to him. Chaplin then found a baby next to the rubbish bins without any parents taking care of him. He took the baby and started to look for his parents. Firstly, he gave the baby to a woman who responded to him angrily, showing that she already had a son. Then, he was punished by the police for trying to abandon him next to the rubbish bins again and he tried to give him to another man who was walking around.  Unfortunately, the man started to purchase him. All of sudden, the man saw a baby carriage and left the baby there but the mother got angry because he was not hers and started to push Chaplin. In fact, she called the police and Chaplin had to take care of the baby again. At first, he thought in abandoning him again, but this time inside a sewage.

A man, through the window, throws rubbles to the street and almost they fall down on him. Caplin, without distresses, cleans the powder of his clothes and continues walking while he smokes. In the walking, somebody goes back to throw rubblesto the street, but now, unfortunately, they fall down on him. He throws out his gloves and lights a cigarette. Suddenly, he finds a baby who is crying in the corner of the street and looks at all sides if there is somebody. Simultaneously, a mother walks behind him with her baby in the covered wagon and Chaplin approaches her. She gets distracted and makes alone the wagon. This situation helps Chaplin to drop the baby inside it. However, the mother notices it and asks him to take ""his"" baby. After that, he, humorously, takes her baby and the mother says no, this baby is hers. Chaplin takes ""his"" baby and the woman goes away. Before that, he decides to leave the baby in the same place where he found him, but a policeman appears and he takes again the baby. In his escape, he sees a man and, discreetly, asks him to take the baby for a moment. In this moment, he decides to run but the man realizes it. Chaplin achieves to  hide in a hallway and the man finds the mother who was found by Chaplin later. The man decides to drop the baby in the wagon because the mother was not there. On the other hand, Chaplin ,after going out of his hiding place, sees the policeman again, but this time without the baby. He pretends and manages to avoid him. The woman realizes the new baby in her wagon and, in the same moment, Chaplin appears walking. She follows him and hits him with her umbrella. Again, she asks him to take the baby and he plays dumb. The policeman appears and the woman tells him what has happened, and Chaplin ends up by taking again the baby. Chaplin, without knowing what to do, sits down in a kerb and sees a sewer. After thinking to leave the baby there, he does not leave him there and decide to see if there is something inside the blanket that covers him. He sees a note that says that this child is orphaned and that pleasetake care of him. After reading this, Chaplin looks shocked at the baby and decides to be in charge of him."

Secondly he founded a baby that at first he thought someone must have lost him so he keep on trying to give it to someone else in order to feel free again with any responsability or blame but then he realised that the baby was and an orphan and something on his inside changed.

He is amazed and takes out a case where he carries cigarettes and lights one. Next, he throws his gloves in a bin. When he leaves, he finds an abandoned baby crying next to buckets. Chaplin, tries to look for the parents, but he doesn’t see anyone, so he takes it. In those moments, an old woman passes with a baby car and another baby, then he thinks it’s hers, addresses the woman and put the baby in the baby car. Then they argue and Charles takes the baby and they leave. Next, he leaves it back where he found it, but a police see him and brings it again.  <br/> Second, when he was walking down the street, he sees a man. He gives him the baby and ties his shoelaces. When he finished, he runs out and hides, then the man leaves the baby in the lady’s baby car that Charles had found at first. When Chaplin leaves his hideout, he passes carelessly down the street where the lady was with the baby car and the two babies, they argue again, the policeman arrives and immediately he takes the baby back and sits on a sidewalk. Right next to it is a sewer, he grabs it and thinks about throwing the baby over there but realizes that the child has a note between his blankets, he reads it. <br/> Finally he thinks that the best thing is to stay with the baby and take care of it.		{'First': 1, ',': 20, 'Charles': 3, 'Chaplin': 3, 'is': 5, 'on': 2, 'a': 10, 'street': 3, 'in': 4, 'poor': 1, 'old': 2, 'town': 1, '.': 15, 'He': 3, 'smoking': 1, 'and': 15, 'suddenly': 1, 'objects': 1, 'fall': 1, 'from': 1, 'above': 1, 'amazed': 1, 'takes': 4, 'out': 2, 'case': 1, 'where': 3, 'he': 18, 'carries': 1, 'cigarettes': 1, 'lights': 1, 'one': 1, 'Next': 2, 'throws': 1, 'his': 4, 'gloves': 1, 'bin': 1, 'When': 3, 'leaves': 4, 'finds': 1, 'an': 2, 'abandoned': 1, 'baby': 13, 'crying': 1, 'next': 2, 'to': 4, 'buckets': 1, 'tries': 1, 'look': 1, 'for': 1, 'the': 20, 'parents': 1, 'but': 3, 'does': 1, 'n’t': 1, 'see': 2, 'anyone': 1, 'so': 1, 'it': 9, 'In': 1, 'those': 1, 'moments': 1, 'woman': 2, 'passes': 2, 'with': 3, 'car': 4, 'another': 1, 'then': 2, 'thinks': 3, '’s': 2, 'hers': 1, 'addresses': 1, 'put': 1, 'Then': 1, 'they': 3, 'argue': 2, 'leave': 1, 'back': 2, 'found': 2, 'police': 1, 'him': 2, 'brings': 1, 'again': 2, ' ': 1, '<': 2, 'br/': 2, '>': 2, 'Second': 1, 'when': 1, 'was': 2, 'walking': 1, 'down': 2, 'sees': 1, 'man': 2, 'gives': 1, 'ties': 1, 'shoelaces': 1, 'finished': 1, 'runs': 1, 'hides': 1, 'lady': 2, 'that': 3, 'had': 1, 'at': 1, 'first': 1, 'hideout': 1, 'carelessly': 1, 'two': 1, 'babies': 1, 'policeman': 1, 'arrives': 1, 'immediately': 1, 'sits': 1, 'sidewalk': 1, 'Right': 1, 'sewer': 1, 'grabs': 1, 'about': 1, 'throwing': 1, 'over': 1, 'there': 1, 'realizes': 1, 'child': 1, 'has': 1, 'note': 1, 'between': 1, 'blankets': 1, 'reads': 1, 'Finally': 1, 'best': 1, 'thing': 1, 'stay': 1, 'take': 1, 'care': 1, 'of': 1}	{'ADV': 22, 'PUNCT': 35, 'PROPN': 8, 'AUX': 9, 'ADP': 22, 'DET': 34, 'NOUN': 49, 'ADJ': 5, 'PRON': 41, 'VERB': 49, 'CCONJ': 18, 'SCONJ': 9, 'NUM': 2, 'PART': 4, 'SPACE': 1, 'X': 5}

The man takes the baby and he tries to give it to a woman when she is not aware of it. He lets the baby inside the woman's baby carriage, but the woman notices it so she gives the baby back to the man because she doesn't want it. He sees a policeman that is taking a walk so he conceals. Then, he sees a man and he asks for him to hold the baby while he ties up his shoes and suddenly he (Chaplin) runs out so the man stays with the baby. The man makes the same tactic about the woman's baby carriage that Chaplin did before and he gets to scape from keeping the baby. Chaplin passes next to that woman who has seen already the baby and she starts to follow him to give him back the baby, and finally she reaches him. Chaplin doesn't know what to do anymore so he sits down on the ground with the baby on his arms and suddenly he sees a note that the baby has inside his clothes and it says that the person who found that orphan baby took care of him and loved him, so Chaplin heeds it and stays with the baby at the end.

He goes under a window where a man is throwing something that provoques some dust, this is ignored by the protagonist. He keeps on walking and while he grabs his flexible walking stick, a lot of rubbish coming from above him, falls over Charlie making him dirty and also scaring him. Then he decides to take his gloves off and throwing them to the rubbish and to smoke a cigarette he took from a metallic box that he had in his pocket. It is then when he finds out there is a baby left on the street's floor crying, so he decides to get the baby and see if he can solve this problem. Chaplin starts looking around and then suddenly sees a woman with a baby car who seems to be looking for something, this makes him thiink it is the baby's mother. When he gets close and gives the baby to the woman, he finds out that he is confused and that the baby does not belong to that woman. After trying to leave the baby back to where he found it, a police walks in the place and make him get the child again. This leeds our protagonist to do what he does next, to fool a man he sees in the street and to give him the baby. This new man does not know what to do and as he sees a baby car with an empty place, he decides to leave the baby there.

Then, Chaplin sees an old man and he gives him the baby. The poor man does not react after a few seconds and he feels nervous so he decides to follow him. After that, the old man put the child in a baby cart which is next to a shop and he goes. When the owner of the baby cart (a lady) leaves from the shop, she realises that there is another child next to her baby.

He kept on walking smoking a cigarrette by the way he found a 2-month baby lying on the floor. He took the baby and looked for someone to take care of, so he saw a woman with another baby and tried to deliver him to her, although that woman wasn't his mom so she didn't accept the kid. <br/> In fact, the woman hit him on the back because she thought he was kidnapping her baby. <br/> He took off the baby and went to the corner where he found the baby and came to left him there, but a policeman watched him and he had to runaway with the baby. Some meters after that, another man walking on the street and Chaplin didn't lose the chance, he tried to give this man the problem..and the real problem came now, whe this new man tried to deliver the baby to the same woman as Chaplin tried before. Then, Chaplin kept on his walk and he watched that woman again..she run to him from his back and hit him again on the head, she left him with the baby and leave the scene. The last minute was emotive because Chaplin noticed that the baby had a handwrite note which told he was an orphan, so Chaplin adopted him as his child."

The protagonist is walking down the street while smoking. In the scene we can see a woman throwing objects out the window. Walking through a place where there is garbage, he picks up another cigarette and while smoking it, he finds a baby on the ground abandoned. He decides to pick it up and at that moment he finds a woman with a stroller for two babies. Seeing that this woman only had one baby in the cart, he places it in the other part of it, thinking that it would belong to the woman. The woman returns the baby to him because it was not hers. Not finding his parents, he places him where he was but at that moment, a policeman appears so he must pick up the baby again so as not to be scolded by the agent. Walking down the street, he gives the baby to a man who passes by. The man, not wanting the baby, casually places the baby in the stroller of the woman who appeared earlier. When the woman realized that the baby was back in the stroller, she blames Chaplin. In addition, the policeman appears, so Chaplin keeps the baby. At the end we see how the baby carried a note that said take care of him. Chaplin decides to stay with him permanently.		{'In': 3, 'the': 24, 'video': 1, 'that': 7, 'I': 1, 'have': 1, 'been': 1, 'able': 1, 'to': 7, 'see': 4, ',': 13, 'we': 3, 'a': 10, 'piece': 1, 'of': 4, 'movie': 1, 'starring': 1, 'Chaplin': 4, '.': 14, 'The': 3, 'protagonist': 1, 'is': 2, 'walking': 1, 'down': 2, 'street': 2, 'while': 2, 'smoking': 2, 'scene': 1, 'can': 1, 'woman': 7, 'throwing': 1, 'objects': 1, 'out': 1, 'window': 1, 'Walking': 2, 'through': 1, 'place': 1, 'where': 2, 'there': 1, 'garbage': 1, 'he': 8, 'picks': 1, 'up': 3, 'another': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'and': 2, 'it': 6, 'finds': 2, 'baby': 10, 'on': 1, 'ground': 1, 'abandoned': 1, 'He': 1, 'decides': 2, 'pick': 2, 'at': 2, 'moment': 2, 'with': 2, 'stroller': 3, 'for': 1, 'two': 1, 'babies': 1, 'Seeing': 1, 'this': 1, 'only': 1, 'had': 1, 'one': 1, 'in': 4, 'cart': 1, 'places': 3, 'other': 1, 'part': 1, 'thinking': 1, 'would': 1, 'belong': 1, 'returns': 1, 'him': 4, 'because': 1, 'was': 3, 'not': 3, 'hers': 1, 'Not': 1, 'finding': 1, 'his': 1, 'parents': 1, 'but': 1, 'policeman': 2, 'appears': 2, 'so': 3, 'must': 1, 'again': 1, 'as': 1, 'be': 1, 'scolded': 1, 'by': 2, 'agent': 1, 'gives': 1, 'man': 2, 'who': 2, 'passes': 1, 'wanting': 1, 'casually': 1, 'appeared': 1, 'earlier': 1, 'When': 1, 'realized': 1, 'back': 1, 'she': 1, 'blames': 1, 'addition': 1, 'keeps': 1, 'At': 1, 'end': 1, 'how': 1, 'carried': 1, 'note': 1, 'said': 1, 'take': 1, 'care': 1, 'stay': 1, 'permanently': 1}	{'ADP': 30, 'DET': 41, 'NOUN': 49, 'PRON': 30, 'AUX': 10, 'ADJ': 2, 'PART': 8, 'VERB': 43, 'PUNCT': 27, 'PROPN': 4, 'SCONJ': 12, 'CCONJ': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'ADV': 8}

Suddenly, he found a little baby crying in the middle of the street and Chaplin did not know exactly what to do. He came up with the idea of giving it to the woman he saw a little after, since she was carrying her baby in a baby buggy, but the woman rejected inmediatedly due to the fact that that child was not her baby. Then, he was going to place the baby in the same spot he was found but a policy agent was watching him, so he could not. After that, he came up with the idea of giving it to a strange with the following excuse ""can you hold my baby for a second please?"". Surprisingly, he could get rid of the baby, but it was just for a minute, since the strange placed the baby in the same baby buggy that Chaplin did, so the woman hit Chaplin several times as soon as she saw him again. Finally, Chaplin had to get the baby out of there and when he was far enough he planned to throw it to the sewage. However, he founded a letter between the cloths of the baby, in which was written the following sentence: ""Please take care of the child"" and after reading that, Chaplin couldn't do anything else than taking care of the baby by his own."

So , he held the baby in his arms wondering who could be the mother of this very little child when he saw a woman taking a baby carriage with a little child inside and he thought that woman was mother's newborn baby that he was taking in his arms and he put the baby in the baby carriage. But surprisingly, that woman was not mother's baby and he put the baby next to the rubbish again but when he was going to continue on his way, he came across with a policeman , who was looking him angrily because of the fact that he had just commited. Then, Chaplin tried to run away of the policeman and he put the baby in the arms of a man who was walking along the same street but the man returned him baby .

He is cunningly treating a really serious and tragic topic through a humoristic sketch. At Chaplin's time, many orphans were abandoned on the streets or in front of orphanage because their, normally, single mothers were unable to give them the life they deserve. In other cases, they abandoned them because they were not supposed to have children or those children were the result of a rape and that fact had to be hidden no matter what it cost. Some of the kids died and many others stayed their whole life in a place where they were not happy nor well-treated. Fortunately, several children had the chance of a brand new life when people like our protagonist decided to take care of those little and vulnerable souls.

He assumes that she is looking for the baby as she is probably the mother. She has another baby in a pram so, Chaplin decides to put the baby in the pram as well. The mother seems to be upset because she is not apparently the mother of the child. Chaplin puts the baby again behind the bin, but a police man discovers him dropping the baby and Chaplin rapidly grabs it again and runs away with it. Later on, he encounters with a man and he tricks him to take the baby. After the man is holding the baby, Chaplin runs away. The man sees the pram which Chaplin saw before and places the baby in it. When the mother discovers the baby in the pram again, she looks for Chaplin and she forces him to take the baby. When Chaplin is holding the baby, he finds out a note underneath its clothes. The note says to take care of the orphaned child. This note makes Chaplin think and he finally decides to take here of him.		{'Charles': 1, 'Chaplin': 9, 'is': 7, 'walking': 1, 'through': 1, 'a': 9, 'street': 1, 'and': 8, ',': 10, 'suddenly': 1, 'he': 7, 'sees': 2, 'baby': 13, 'abandoned': 1, 'behind': 2, 'bin': 2, '.': 13, 'He': 2, 'decides': 3, 'to': 8, 'grab': 1, 'the': 21, 'when': 1, 'thinking': 1, 'of': 4, 'solution': 1, 'watches': 1, 'woman': 1, 'that': 2, 'seems': 2, 'be': 2, 'looking': 2, 'for': 3, 'something': 1, 'or': 1, 'someone': 1, 'assumes': 1, 'she': 5, 'as': 2, 'probably': 1, 'mother': 4, 'She': 1, 'has': 1, 'another': 1, 'in': 4, 'pram': 4, 'so': 1, 'put': 1, 'well': 1, 'The': 3, 'upset': 1, 'because': 1, 'not': 1, 'apparently': 1, 'child': 2, 'puts': 1, 'again': 3, 'but': 1, 'police': 1, 'man': 4, 'discovers': 2, 'him': 4, 'dropping': 1, 'rapidly': 1, 'grabs': 1, 'it': 3, 'runs': 2, 'away': 2, 'with': 2, 'Later': 1, 'on': 1, 'encounters': 1, 'tricks': 1, 'take': 4, 'After': 1, 'holding': 2, 'which': 1, 'saw': 1, 'before': 1, 'places': 1, 'When': 2, 'looks': 1, 'forces': 1, 'finds': 1, 'out': 1, 'note': 3, 'underneath': 1, 'its': 1, 'clothes': 1, 'says': 1, 'care': 1, 'orphaned': 1, 'This': 1, 'makes': 1, 'think': 1, 'finally': 1, 'here': 1}	{'PROPN': 10, 'AUX': 9, 'VERB': 41, 'ADP': 18, 'DET': 35, 'NOUN': 38, 'CCONJ': 10, 'PUNCT': 23, 'ADV': 17, 'PRON': 27, 'PART': 9, 'SCONJ': 7, 'ADJ': 1}

It’s interesting the fact that everything is clearly understood despite no one speaks a single word.		{'Chaplin': 1, 'appears': 1, 'walking': 1, 'on': 1, 'the': 4, 'street': 1, 'apparently': 1, 'doing': 1, 'nothingt': 1, '.': 5, 'He': 2, 'finds': 1, 'a': 3, 'lost': 1, 'baby': 3, 'and': 2, 'cares': 1, 'about': 1, 'it': 2, 'wondering': 1, 'what': 2, 'happened': 1, 'to': 4, 'him': 1, 'After': 1, 'many': 1, 'attempts': 1, 'find': 1, 'someone': 1, 'who': 1, 'takes': 1, 'thinking': 1, 'do': 1, ',': 1, 'he': 1, 'decides': 1, 'keep': 1, 'himself': 1, 'discovers': 1, 'note': 1, 'in': 1, '’s': 2, 'jacket': 1, 'that': 2, 'makes': 1, 'his': 1, 'mind': 1, 'change': 1, 'It': 1, 'interesting': 1, 'fact': 1, 'everything': 1, 'is': 1, 'clearly': 1, 'understood': 1, 'despite': 1, 'no': 1, 'one': 1, 'speaks': 1, 'single': 1, 'word': 1}	{'PROPN': 1, 'VERB': 19, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 8, 'NOUN': 13, 'ADV': 2, 'PUNCT': 6, 'PRON': 15, 'CCONJ': 2, 'ADJ': 3, 'PART': 4, 'SCONJ': 2, 'AUX': 1}

Chaplin	written_online	10.0	Outside classroom		During a walk through an industrial area and while enjoying a cuban cigar, Chaplin suddenly gets hit by some bricks. By lighting a cigarette, he then discovers an abandoned baby on the ground, worried and after seeing a mum going for a walk with her baby, he thinks she had dropped the baby. Quickly and convinced that the baby belongs to her, he takes the baby to the lady. Nevertheless, the lady gets mad, rejecting the fact of being her baby. With him among is hands again, Chaplin tries to put him back where he had found him but, just before doing so, a police officer crosses by, scaring him from abandoning the child. Afterwards, he walks away from the officer and, by tricking an old man, he gets rid of the baby. Unluckily, the old man crosses the lady and leaves the baby in the lady's wheel without she realizing what was happening. Happy and relaxed, Chaplin walks by the lady again in the exact moment she realizes the baby was again in her chariot, thinking it was Chaplin again trying to get rid of him. Finally, Chaplin takes the baby and soon discovers there was a note with him, saying he was an orphan child and asking for help. Happy again, Chaplin stands up and keeps walking happy with his new child.

Chaplin	written_online	17.0	Outside classroom		This shortfilm with Charles Chaplin acting on it starts with the actor walking on the street while someone's throwing garbage from the balconies. He looks up and seems to think that those people throwing things are acting weird. Then he stops next to a bin, he opens a box with cigars, takes one and saves the box again on his pocket, and gets to light the cigar with his shoe. Suddenly, he finds out there's a baby hidden next to the bin covered with some baby blankets, it seems he's been abandoned. The man grabs him from the street, and as he has seen a woman having a walk with a pushchair and another baby, he recabes her and tell her that she has left the baby behind, but the woman yells at him and tell him to take him again because it's not her baby. After that, he tries to put the baby again where he found him, but then a policeman appears on scene and takes the baby again with him. Thinking how to get the baby away from him, he goes on a walk and when he finds a man, he asks him to Carry the baby for a moment while he puts correctly the laces of his shoe. But it was a trick to leave the baby on anyone's hands! He goes away and the man with the baby stands  without knowing what to do, but then he finds a pushchair on the street with another baby, leaves the baby on that same pushchair and goes away. By the time the woman goes out of the shop she was in, the man who found the baby at first pass by, and the woman goes yelling and hitting him again, making him to take the baby with him again. Desesperate, he sits on the street with the baby on his arms, and finds he carries a note with him asking to love and care this orphan child. Finally, he seems to like the idea of taking care of the baby, and even he smiles at him!

There is plenty of rubbish in the street and he seems to be a bit exhasperated. Then, he finds a baby in a corner and he takes him and looks around in order to find his parents, but no one is there. Afterwards there appears a woman carrying another baby and Chaplin tries to leave his with them, but the lady rejects him rudely. When Chaplin realises the issue he has, he tries to leave the child where he has found him a moment before, but, as soon as he does it, a policeman comes into the scene and he has to take the baby back. Then, he gaves him to a homeless and that man manages to leave the baby with the woman, as Chaplin has tried. Unfortunately, Chaplin is found by the lady, who gives the baby to him. Chaplin sits down in the border of the sidewalk and there he finds a note written by the parents of the baby among his clothes. They ask for taking care of the baby and so Chaplin does.		{'This': 1, 'is': 4, 'an': 1, 'usual': 1, 'movie': 1, 'from': 1, 'Chaplin': 7, '.': 10, 'In': 1, 'the': 16, 'first': 1, 'scene': 2, ',': 12, 'he': 11, 'appears': 2, 'wandering': 1, 'across': 1, 'what': 1, 'seems': 2, 'to': 9, 'be': 2, 'a': 9, 'working': 1, 'class': 1, 'neightbourhood': 1, 'There': 1, 'plenty': 1, 'of': 4, 'rubbish': 1, 'in': 4, 'street': 1, 'and': 8, 'bit': 1, 'exhasperated': 1, 'Then': 2, 'finds': 2, 'baby': 7, 'corner': 1, 'takes': 1, 'him': 5, 'looks': 1, 'around': 1, 'order': 1, 'find': 1, 'his': 3, 'parents': 2, 'but': 3, 'no': 1, 'one': 1, 'there': 3, 'Afterwards': 1, 'woman': 2, 'carrying': 1, 'another': 1, 'tries': 2, 'leave': 3, 'with': 2, 'them': 1, 'lady': 2, 'rejects': 1, 'rudely': 1, 'When': 1, 'realises': 1, 'issue': 1, 'has': 4, 'child': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 2, 'moment': 1, 'before': 1, 'as': 3, 'soon': 1, 'does': 2, 'it': 1, 'policeman': 1, 'comes': 1, 'into': 1, 'take': 1, 'back': 1, 'gaves': 1, 'homeless': 1, 'that': 1, 'man': 1, 'manages': 1, 'tried': 1, 'Unfortunately': 1, 'by': 2, 'who': 1, 'gives': 1, 'sits': 1, 'down': 1, 'border': 1, 'sidewalk': 1, 'note': 1, 'written': 1, 'among': 1, 'clothes': 1, 'They': 1, 'ask': 1, 'for': 1, 'taking': 1, 'care': 1, 'so': 1}	{'PRON': 27, 'AUX': 7, 'DET': 29, 'ADJ': 4, 'NOUN': 35, 'ADP': 22, 'PROPN': 7, 'PUNCT': 22, 'VERB': 36, 'PART': 7, 'CCONJ': 11, 'ADV': 12, 'SCONJ': 4}

The first one seems to be well dressed, although it is contradictory at the moment in which a cigarette case appears and he appropriates it. He is in an alley where he is struck by debris. After this, a baby is found lying on the street with no one around. At this point, the protagonist does not know very well what to do and desperately he tries to get rid of him but he can’t achieve it. Suddenly he stumbles over the police and picks up the baby again. However, he continues in the attempt to get rid of the baby by leaving him to another man who appears in the street. The man returns the baby to a baby car and the owner of it returns him to Charles Chaplin again. It seems as if it was fate, trying to give the protagonist somebody to stay with, to stop that feeling of loneliness that he may have. He is still thinking of somewhere to leave the baby but he seems to be worried in turn and he seems to be accepting the reality. Then, he finds a note inside the baby's clothes in which someone asks the one who finds the baby to love and care for him, because he is orphaned. Suddenly, the man seems to feel sorry and at the same time content. Finally, he begins to make the baby smile and leaves with him. The video presents a tone of tragedy where there is fear and pity but at the end there is a sense of happiness and hope for that baby.

The scene is about Chaplin that, while he is smoking on the street, he finds a baby lying on the floor. He might have been abandoned. Chaplin decides that he has to find a place for the baby and therefore, he starts thinking what to do. Suddenly, he sees a woman that is carrying her own baby on a trolley. Chaplin thinks that the baby is hers or that maybe she could take care of him. However, when Chaplin puts the baby in the trolley, the woman shouts at him as the baby is not hers. Because of that, Chaplin decides to put the baby again on the place where he found him but, a police officer warns Chaplin that he cannot abandone a baby, as if he or she was his own child. Chaplin takes the baby again on his arms and starts walking on the street. He sees another man and Chaplin gives the baby to him. This aforementioned man sees the trolley of the prior woman again. When the woman realizes that the baby is again on the trolley, she gives the baby to Chaplin as if it was him the one who put the baby there. As Chaplin do not get to find a place for the baby, he decides to take a rest to think and he sits on the street with the baby on his arms. At that moment, he finds a note from the actual mother of the baby, saying that please take care of the child as he was yours. As a consequence, Chaplin decides to adopt the baby.		{'This': 2, 'is': 7, 'a': 11, 'scene': 2, 'of': 6, 'the': 29, 'film': 1, 'The': 2, 'Kid': 1, 'by': 1, 'Charles': 1, 'Chaplin': 12, '.': 15, 'about': 1, 'that': 10, ',': 14, 'while': 1, 'he': 12, 'smoking': 1, 'on': 9, 'street': 3, 'finds': 2, 'baby': 17, 'lying': 1, 'floor': 1, 'He': 2, 'might': 1, 'have': 1, 'been': 1, 'abandoned': 1, 'decides': 4, 'has': 1, 'to': 9, 'find': 2, 'place': 3, 'for': 2, 'and': 4, 'therefore': 1, 'starts': 2, 'thinking': 1, 'what': 1, 'do': 2, 'Suddenly': 1, 'sees': 3, 'woman': 4, 'carrying': 1, 'her': 1, 'own': 2, 'trolley': 4, 'thinks': 1, 'hers': 2, 'or': 2, 'maybe': 1, 'she': 3, 'could': 1, 'take': 3, 'care': 2, 'him': 5, 'However': 1, 'when': 1, 'puts': 1, 'in': 1, 'shouts': 1, 'at': 1, 'as': 4, 'not': 3, 'Because': 1, 'put': 2, 'again': 4, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'but': 1, 'police': 1, 'officer': 1, 'warns': 1, 'can': 1, 'abandone': 1, 'if': 2, 'was': 3, 'his': 3, 'child': 2, 'takes': 1, 'arms': 2, 'walking': 1, 'another': 1, 'man': 2, 'gives': 2, 'aforementioned': 1, 'prior': 1, 'When': 1, 'realizes': 1, 'it': 1, 'one': 1, 'who': 1, 'there': 1, 'As': 2, 'get': 1, 'rest': 1, 'think': 1, 'sits': 1, 'with': 1, 'At': 1, 'moment': 1, 'note': 1, 'from': 1, 'actual': 1, 'mother': 1, 'saying': 1, 'please': 1, 'yours': 1, 'consequence': 1, 'adopt': 1}	{'PRON': 34, 'AUX': 16, 'DET': 45, 'NOUN': 53, 'ADP': 27, 'PROPN': 14, 'PUNCT': 29, 'SCONJ': 19, 'VERB': 40, 'PART': 10, 'CCONJ': 7, 'ADV': 9, 'ADJ': 5, 'INTJ': 1}

The lady hits him because that baby is not hers, and Chaplin has to take the baby out again. When he is trying to leave the baby in the place where he found him, a policeman sees him and he has to pretend he is taking care of the baby.

Then, he opened his cigarette box to look for a new one because the cigarette that he was smoking has dropped. When he lights the new cigarette and have it into his mouth, a baby shows up next to him. As he does not know where the baby has dropped from, he thinks that it may belong to a woman that has other baby, thus, he puts the baby into the baby cart of the woman. However, the woman denies that the baby is hers. He is uncertain about what to do with the baby, so, he decides to leave them on the ground where he found them. When he was close to leave the baby there, a policeman came and he had to pick up the baby. After all that did not work, he decides to give the baby to an old man while he tie his shoelaces. Immediately, he runs away and hides at the same time that the old man holds the baby. That old man finds the same woman with the baby cart and he introduces the baby there. Then, the woman sees the first man walking around and thinks that he has put the baby inside the baby cart again, therefore, he had to pick up the baby. Finally, he accepts his fate and sits on a kerb where he realizes that there is a note that says that this baby is an orphan. At the end, he seems to understand the situation of the baby and he decides to take care of them.		{'A': 1, 'man': 5, 'is': 5, 'smoking': 2, 'while': 2, 'walking': 2, 'on': 3, 'the': 28, 'street': 1, '.': 14, 'Suddenly': 1, ',': 17, 'a': 8, 'heap': 1, 'of': 4, 'rubbles': 1, 'hit': 1, 'him': 2, 'falling': 1, 'down': 1, 'from': 2, 'building': 1, 'Then': 2, 'he': 20, 'opened': 1, 'his': 4, 'cigarette': 3, 'box': 1, 'to': 12, 'look': 1, 'for': 1, 'new': 2, 'one': 1, 'because': 1, 'that': 10, 'was': 2, 'has': 4, 'dropped': 2, 'When': 2, 'lights': 1, 'and': 7, 'have': 1, 'it': 2, 'into': 2, 'mouth': 1, 'baby': 18, 'shows': 1, 'up': 3, 'next': 1, 'As': 1, 'does': 1, 'not': 2, 'know': 1, 'where': 3, 'thinks': 2, 'may': 1, 'belong': 1, 'woman': 5, 'other': 1, 'thus': 1, 'puts': 1, 'cart': 3, 'However': 1, 'denies': 1, 'hers': 1, 'He': 1, 'uncertain': 1, 'about': 1, 'what': 1, 'do': 1, 'with': 2, 'so': 1, 'decides': 3, 'leave': 2, 'them': 3, 'ground': 1, 'found': 1, 'close': 1, 'there': 3, 'policeman': 1, 'came': 1, 'had': 2, 'pick': 2, 'After': 1, 'all': 1, 'did': 1, 'work': 1, 'give': 1, 'an': 2, 'old': 3, 'tie': 1, 'shoelaces': 1, 'Immediately': 1, 'runs': 1, 'away': 1, 'hides': 1, 'at': 1, 'same': 2, 'time': 1, 'holds': 1, 'That': 1, 'finds': 1, 'introduces': 1, 'sees': 1, 'first': 1, 'around': 1, 'put': 1, 'inside': 1, 'again': 1, 'therefore': 1, 'Finally': 1, 'accepts': 1, 'fate': 1, 'sits': 1, 'kerb': 1, 'realizes': 1, 'note': 1, 'says': 1, 'this': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'At': 1, 'end': 1, 'seems': 1, 'understand': 1, 'situation': 1, 'take': 1, 'care': 1}	{'DET': 41, 'NOUN': 53, 'AUX': 13, 'VERB': 48, 'SCONJ': 15, 'ADP': 26, 'PUNCT': 31, 'ADV': 15, 'PRON': 40, 'PART': 11, 'ADJ': 11, 'CCONJ': 7}

He then puts his cane on his left arm, takes off his right glove and slowly his left glove. Takes the cigaro that he saved and lits it with the sole of his shoe and smokes. After that, he throws the gloves to the bin and shakes his hands. When he looks to his left, he sees a little baby. Aftet wondering why he is here or why isn't anyone there, picks them. He looks behind him and sees a woman with a trolley and tries to call her. The woman with the trolley enters the building and Chaplin goes where the trolley is.He then drops the baby in the trolley with another baby and says ""Pardon me, you dropped something."" They start arguing and Chaplin takes the baby he picked and leaves. He decides to leave the baby where he encountered it but when he turns back he sees a police officer and takes again the baby. Walking down the street he noticed that his shoes aren't tied. He gives the baby to an old man and ties his shoes and runs away, hiding in a house. <br/> The old man sees the trolley and leaves the baby there again and runs away. Chaplin goes out of his hidden place and faces the police officer. Scared, walks away.  <br/> He walks by the trolley and the woman sees him again, yelling at him. She hits him with the umbrella and Chaplin falls to the floor. He stands up and the woman continues hitting him on the way to the trolley. She then tells him about the baby in the trolley and they start arguing again. The police officer sees them, Chaplin takes the baby and runs and the woman takes her trolley and leaves too. <br/> The police officer stares at Chaplin while he goes away and leaves the scene too. <br/> The next scene, there is Chaplin with the baby and his cane. The cane drops of him. He sits and takes the cane and puts him on his side. He sees a sewer, opens it and thinks about dropping the baby there. He gives up the idea.

Then, a policeman catches Charles leaving the baby where he found him earlier so he must pick him up again. Next, he meets a man and with the excuse of tying his shoes asks him to hold the baby and then run away without him. This man stays with the baby in his arms and not knowing what to do, so he decides to put him in a woman's baby carriage, which is the same woman Charles discussed earlier with. This woman returns to catch Charles thinking that it was he who has abandoned the baby in his carriage, so he returns to discuss with him and Charles must return to take care of the baby.

At the beginning of the video, we see Charles Chaplin taken a walk around a building under construction. He is lighting a cigarette when he notices a baby on the ground. He looks around trying to find the baby's mom. He finds out a woman carrying a two-seater baby carriage with only one baby in. So he decides to put the other baby back in the carriage. She gets angry and give back the baby to Charles Chaplin. Then, he decides to put the baby back where he found him but a policeman sees him and scolds him. Chaplin takes the baby again but he gets to trick an old man to keep him. The old man leaves the baby on the carriage of the woman that Chaplin meets before. When she realizes, she sees Chaplin walking down the street and gives the baby back again to him. Finally Chaplin sits down the street and find a letter into the baby's clothes that says something like: ""please, give love to this orphan baby"".

He is looking around and suddenly he finds a baby near the dumpster. Firstly, Chaplin is amazed and he starts looking for the baby's parents, so when he sees a woman with a twins carriage, he thinks that the baby is from her and he put it on the baby carriage but it is not and the angry woman give back the baby to Chaplin. Secondly, Chaplin doesn't want to take care of the baby so he leave the it near the dumpster, the problem is that a police man is watching what he does and Chaplin have to take again the baby. Chaplin without knowing watt else to do, gives the baby to a man who is walking around the street and he starts running. Even though, the baby is returned to Chaplin, because the man who was with the baby left it with the woman we talked about before and she gave the baby to Chaplin with the police in front of them. Finally, Chaplin, even thinking of leaving the baby in a sewer, finds a note that the baby carried which says love and care the baby, so in the end Chaplin becomes fond of the baby.

He smokes a cigarette and he throws his gloves to the bin. Furthermore, he finds a baby in the bin and tries to find his mother. Besides, he talks to a woman with another baby and asks to her if it is her baby too. She denies it so he brings the baby back to the bin but a police man sees him. Afterwards he sees an old man in the street, gives the baby to him and runs away. Apart from that, the old man leaves the baby in the women's baby stroller. Moreover, when she finds the baby there she suspects of Chaplin and starts sticking him with an umbrella.

At first he thinks that it is of a woman who was there with another baby, but the woman denies it and returns the child to him. Then Chaplin try to leave the baby where he had found him, but a police officer arrives, so he picks up the baby and continues on his way. He finds a man and disguise to give the child. The man puts the baby in the cart of the same woman as before, and when the woman realizes that, she thinks it was Chaplin and makes him pick it up again. Finally, Chaplin finds a note between the baby's clothes that says he was orphaned and need love, so he is in charge of him.

Suddenly, a woman appeared running with a baby trolley and Chaplin thought it was the baby's mum. He talked with her about the baby, but the mum replied that he was not her baby. After that, Chaplin tried to leave the baby in the first place he found it, but the police arrived and, afraid about that wrong action, Chaplin decided to take the baby away with him. He decided to leave it with the woman again though, he had the same answer.

It begins with him walking down the street and getting hit by a trash bin, afterwards he complains about it to the person who has thrown him the bin and when he looks down to the flooor to point the rubbish he notices thaat there is a baby covered in matresses who has been abanoned. Then he decides that he has to pick it up to find out a solution. After this he sees a woman that is in the same street with her baby so he supposses that the baby he has just found on the floor must be hers and he gives it to her and leaves; as soon as he is leaving the woman starts screaming at him because that is not her baby so he has to take it again and find out another solution. <br/> Afterwards he sees what it looks like a homeless person that according to Charles is the perfect person to take care of the baby and he jokes him by asking to carry the baby for a second while he ties his shoes, but instead he starts running away and leaves the baby with this randome person. <br/> Later on there is a scene in which this person sees the previous woman that was with her baby again and he has the exact same idea of giving it to her assuing its hers, but in this case the woman does not notice and when she finds out the baby is again with her  she sees Charles passing by again and starts screaming at him. Thus Charles has to carry again with the abandoned baby. And in the last seconds of the movie we can see how Charles takes a note out of the matresses's baby which says to take care of the baby		"{'In': 1, 'this': 5, 'video': 1, 'we': 2, 'can': 2, 'find': 3, 'Charles': 5, 'Chapplin': 1, 'on': 3, 'one': 1, 'of': 6, 'his': 2, 'movies': 1, '.': 7, 'It': 1, 'begins': 1, 'with': 6, 'him': 5, 'walking': 1, 'down': 2, 'the': 22, 'street': 2, 'and': 10, 'getting': 1, 'hit': 1, 'by': 3, 'a': 8, 'trash': 1, 'bin': 2, ',': 3, 'afterwards': 1, 'he': 16, 'complains': 1, 'about': 1, 'it': 6, 'to': 13, 'person': 5, 'who': 2, 'has': 7, 'thrown': 1, 'when': 2, 'looks': 2, 'flooor': 1, 'point': 1, 'rubbish': 1, 'notices': 1, 'thaat': 1, 'there': 2, 'is': 7, 'baby': 12, 'covered': 1, 'in': 5, 'matresses': 2, 'been': 1, 'abanoned': 1, 'Then': 1, 'decides': 1, 'that': 6, 'pick': 1, 'up': 1, 'out': 4, 'solution': 2, 'After': 1, 'sees': 4, 'woman': 4, 'same': 2, 'her': 6, 'so': 2, 'supposses': 1, 'just': 1, 'found': 1, 'floor': 1, 'must': 1, 'be': 1, 'hers': 2, 'gives': 1, 'leaves': 2, ';': 1, 'as': 2, 'soon': 1, 'leaving': 1, 'starts': 3, 'screaming': 2, 'at': 2, 'because': 1, 'not': 2, 'take': 3, 'again': 5, 'another': 1, '<': 2, 'br/': 2, '>': 2, 'Afterwards': 1, 'what': 1, 'like': 1, 'homeless': 1, 'according': 1, 'perfect': 1, 'care': 2, 'jokes': 1, 'asking': 1, 'carry': 2, 'for': 1, 'second': 1, 'while': 1, 'ties': 1, 'shoes': 1, 'but': 2, 'instead': 1, 'running': 1, 'away': 1, 'randome': 1, 'Later': 1, 'scene': 1, 'which': 2, 'previous': 1, 'was': 1, 'exact': 1, 'idea': 1, 'giving': 1, 'assuing': 1, 'its': 1, 'case': 1, 'does': 1, 'notice': 1, 'she': 2, 'finds': 1, ' ': 1, 'passing': 1, 'Thus': 1, 'abandoned': 1, 'And': 1, 'last': 1, 'seconds': 1, 'movie': 1, 'see': 1, 'how': 1, 'takes': 1, 'note': 1, ""'s"": 1, 'says': 1}"	{'ADP': 40, 'DET': 35, 'NOUN': 47, 'PRON': 54, 'AUX': 16, 'VERB': 55, 'PROPN': 7, 'NUM': 1, 'PUNCT': 11, 'CCONJ': 13, 'ADV': 17, 'SCONJ': 10, 'PART': 11, 'ADJ': 9, 'X': 5, 'SPACE': 1}

The woman, who was carrying the trolley, argues with Chaplin because the baby was not hers. Chaplin takes the baby and tries to put him on the floor where he found it. Unfortunately, a police officer sees what he was doing, so Chaplin picks up the baby from the floor. Chaplin finds an old man on a walk and gives the baby to him. The old man finds the woman with the trolley and gives the baby to her, but he drops the scarf. So, when Chaplin was walking, the woman finds him and hits him with an umbrella because she thought it was Chaplin the one who put the baby on the trolley.

He is not that lucky with the second person who's doing the same, and all the garbage falls on him. He seems a little bit upset and shakes off his suit; then, he picks one of the many unfinished cigars he has in his tobacco pouch, takes off his gloves, lights a match with the sole of his shoe and starts smoking, finally throwing his gloves to the bin next to him. All of a sudden, a baby starts crying, the poor thing is wrapped with sheets next to somebody's trash. Chaplin looks up, left and right, confused. He decides to take the baby when a woman, pushing a pram, is crossing the street behind; he thinks the baby might be hers and leaves him or her inside with the other baby. The woman starts yelling at him/her so, he takes him/her back to where he found him/her. But, a police officer, who's watching, thinks he is abandoning the baby; therefore, Chaplin has to take the kid again in his arms and leaves. He finds an old man, and asks him to take the baby while he fixes his shoe, but he runs away. The old man goes after him but he is hidden. <br/> The old man sees the pram half empty and lies the baby there. Chaplin comes out of his secret place and walks the officer again as if nothing would have happened. When he thinks it all has ended, he runs into the woman with the pram and she hits him with her umbrella, forcing him to take the baby; the presence of the officer in the scene again makes him leave quickly with the kid in his arms, not so sure of what to do. He seats on the sidewalk,  looking at the baby and he finds a note in the sheets the kid's covered with which says 'please, love and care for this orphan child', and he finally keeps him/her.

Next, Chaplin tries to return the boy to where he found him, but a policeman who was passing by there stares at him and he ends up picking up the baby again. Finally, he manages to leave it to a lame man, apparently a homeless man, who decides to leave it again in the lady's baby carriage.

Since the beginnig we can see that it was not a paceful walk: some bricks started to fall down and almost hit him. However, this was not the worst part. After lighting a cigarette, he finds an abandoned baby next to a trash can. At first, he obviously did not know what to do with the baby. A few seconds later, a woman walking a  <br/> baby stroller passed by, therefore, he tried to put the baby inside it but he woman did not want him either. He tried to leave it where he had found it but a police officer appeared so he took the baby again. After this he tricked an old man and gave the baby to him and this old man did the same thing as Charlie, he put the baby into the same woman's baby stroller. As soon as she saw Charlie, she gave the baby to him again. At the end he keeps the baby.

After that, he picks up a broken cigarette and a match and starts to smoke. Suddenly, he realises that there is an abandoned baby next a that rubbish bin. He picks up the baby and starts to look for his parents. Charles thinks that he has found his mother but when he tries to give the baby to her, she refuses to take the baby. After that he come across a policeman and the policeman thinks that Charles is abandoning that baby. Charles stays with the baby looking for someone who can take care of him and he does so. He finds a stranger, tells him to hold the baby for a moment and he starts to scape from that stranger. The stranger, now in possesion of the abandoned baby manages to find the same mother that Charles found and tries to put the baby with her. The mother finds out that the abandoned baby is with her again and unluckily for Charles, who was walking in the same place as she was, the unknown mother gives Charles the baby again and he decides to stay with him. Finally, he sits somewhere else with the baby and he finds a note inside the baby clothes. That note basically said that the person who would find that baby should love and take care of him as if he were his father.		{'Chaplin': 1, 'was': 3, 'walking': 2, 'down': 1, 'the': 17, 'street': 1, 'and': 12, 'people': 1, 'started': 1, 'to': 11, 'throw': 1, 'rubbish': 2, 'from': 2, 'their': 1, 'windows': 1, '.': 12, 'After': 2, 'that': 12, ',': 8, 'he': 11, 'picks': 2, 'up': 2, 'a': 7, 'broken': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'match': 1, 'starts': 3, 'smoke': 1, 'Suddenly': 1, 'realises': 1, 'there': 1, 'is': 3, 'an': 1, 'abandoned': 3, 'baby': 14, 'next': 1, 'bin': 1, 'He': 2, 'look': 1, 'for': 4, 'his': 3, 'parents': 1, 'Charles': 6, 'thinks': 2, 'has': 1, 'found': 2, 'mother': 4, 'but': 1, 'when': 1, 'tries': 2, 'give': 1, 'her': 3, 'she': 2, 'refuses': 1, 'take': 3, 'come': 1, 'across': 1, 'policeman': 2, 'abandoning': 1, 'stays': 1, 'with': 5, 'looking': 1, 'someone': 1, 'who': 3, 'can': 1, 'care': 2, 'of': 3, 'him': 4, 'does': 1, 'so': 1, 'finds': 3, 'stranger': 3, 'tells': 1, 'hold': 1, 'moment': 1, 'scape': 1, 'The': 2, 'now': 1, 'in': 2, 'possesion': 1, 'manages': 1, 'find': 2, 'same': 2, 'put': 1, 'out': 1, 'again': 2, 'unluckily': 1, 'place': 1, 'as': 2, 'unknown': 1, 'gives': 1, 'decides': 1, 'stay': 1, 'Finally': 1, 'sits': 1, 'somewhere': 1, 'else': 1, 'note': 2, 'inside': 1, 'clothes': 1, 'That': 1, 'basically': 1, 'said': 1, 'person': 1, 'would': 1, 'should': 1, 'love': 1, 'if': 1, 'were': 1, 'father': 1}	{'PROPN': 9, 'AUX': 10, 'VERB': 48, 'ADP': 26, 'DET': 31, 'NOUN': 40, 'CCONJ': 13, 'PART': 10, 'PRON': 34, 'PUNCT': 20, 'ADJ': 4, 'ADV': 10, 'SCONJ': 10}

After that, he lights a cigarette and realises that there is a baby on the floor of the street. He picks him up and puts him into a baby buggy that a lady is pushing, but that she gives back to Chaplin with anger. He returns the baby back to the place where he found him at the beggining, when a police officer appears forcing Chaplin not to leave the baby there. He finds another man on the street and puts the baby in his arms as he pretends to tie his shoes and then he runs aways. The man tries to chase him but as he can't reach him he also puts the baby in the lady's baby buggy. The lady realises this as Chaplin in passing by in front of her in that moment and thinking he left the baby again she starts to hit him with her umbrella. She advices the police officer and Chaplin has no other option than taking the baby with him. He sits on the street with the baby in his arms and sees a note saying to take care of the orphan child. He smiles at the baby and then he leaves with him.

Then he stopped because he wanted to take a cigarette from his cigarette box. He was smoking when he realized that a baby was on the ground. He takes the baby and firstly, he thought that the baby was the child of a woman that was passing by. Then, he puts the baby in the pram the woman was carrying with another baby. When the woman saw what was happening, told him that the baby wasn't hers. The man took the baby again and tried to give the baby to another man that was on the street and run away, but that man did the same as him in the first place: he put the baby in the same pram of the same woman. Finally, the woman gave the baby to the first man again (beating him first with her umbrella) and the man, in order not to have problems with the authorities, took the baby again. He found a note with a message written. The message said something like: please love and care for this orphen child. He smiled and hugged the baby.

Once he left the child with the man, he ran away so that he could get finally rid of the baby, but the man leaves the baby in the trolly of the woman previously mentioned.

He gets mad and insults one person who throws the rubbish directly to him. After this, Chaplin starts smoking until he finds an abandoned baby in the street. He takes the baby in his arms while he starts looking for the baby's parents. Soon he finds a woman who is supposed to be the mother of the child, but in fact she is not. Chaplin continues his journey to find the parents of the baby, finding first a policeman and then a bearded man whom Chaplin tries to give the baby away while running to get out of there the fastest as a possible. The woman that we saw at the beginning finds the baby and angrily chases Chaplin. She hits him with her umbrella forcing him to take the baby with him again. Desperate and without knowing what to do, he sits on the street while carrying the baby in his arms. Even though he thinks about abandoning the baby there, he is no able to do so. Finally he finds a note in the baby's clothes asking for someone to take care and give love to their baby. The video ends up as Chaplin adopts the baby while smiling.

During his walk he finds an abandoned little baby crying next to a trash bin. He tries to find her mother and tries to give the baby to every single person he finds; first to a woman that is wearing a little child in his buggy. But the woman rejects him because he is not his baby. Then Chaplin decides to left the baby where he finds him, but a police officer appears and decides to carry the baby with him. Later, he sees and old man and leaves the baby with him while he is tying his laces. Then, the old man sees the buggy’s woman and leaves the baby there and run away. The woman realizes that again the abandon baby is on his buggy and sees Chaplin walking over there, so she gives him the baby once again.

Then, another man shows up and grabs the baby as well but he doesn't know what to do with him or her, so, again, he leaves the baby in the same baby carriage that he finds while the owner is not looking. As the police is waching around, these characters are trying to scape from him. Finally, Chaplin has to grab the baby again, but he discovers a note that the baby has hidden between the blankets.

He complains about that and stops himself to make another cigarette, but, before continuing the walk, he finds a baby in a corner and takes it. He then sees a woman with an empty place in a baby chair and put the baby on it, but the woman starts to argue with him because it is not her baby. Charlot takes the baby with him to let it where he found it, but, suddenly, a police officer appears and Charlot takes the baby again immediately. After that, he finds an old man and ask him to hold the baby for a moment and run away. The old man let the baby on the baby chair of the former woman, but when the woman realizes that has two babies and sees Charlot, she run to hit him and, seeing again the police officer, Charlot takes again the baby. Charlot doesn't know what to do with the baby. After some time of reflection, he finds out a note in the baby's clothes asking for love care for the child that maybe his mother wrote before abandoning him. Charlot smiles and goes back home to take care of the baby.

Neighbours are throwing rubbish from their windows, falling on him. All of a sudden, Chaplin finds a little baby on the ground and he picks him up. He wonders why the baby is there alone and sees a lady walking by with another baby. He runs to place the abandoned baby next to the lady’s kid. However, she realises it and he has to keep the baby for himself.  <br/> After that, he decides to leave him on the ground again, but a police officer catches him doing it and he has to keep him. Next, Chaplin gives the baby to an old man walking down the street and starts running away. The old man gives the little baby to the very same woman to whom the baby was given before. The moment she realises, Chaplin is walking next to her, so she just runs to catch him and hits him in the head with her umbrella.  <br/> Chaplin has the baby again and he does not know what to do anymore. He just sits down, holding the baby. He finds a piece of paper hidden between the baby’s clothes and reads it. He realises he is an orphan boy, so he is brave and decides to take care of him.		{'One': 1, 'day': 1, ',': 13, 'Chaplin': 5, 'is': 5, 'walking': 4, 'down': 3, 'the': 16, 'street': 2, 'smoking': 1, 'and': 10, 'checking': 1, 'his': 1, 'clothes': 2, 'are': 2, 'looking': 1, 'good': 1, '.': 14, 'Neighbours': 1, 'throwing': 1, 'rubbish': 1, 'from': 1, 'their': 1, 'windows': 1, 'falling': 1, 'on': 3, 'him': 8, 'All': 1, 'of': 3, 'a': 5, 'sudden': 1, 'finds': 2, 'little': 2, 'baby': 11, 'ground': 2, 'he': 7, 'picks': 1, 'up': 1, 'He': 5, 'wonders': 1, 'why': 1, 'there': 1, 'alone': 1, 'sees': 1, 'lady': 2, 'by': 1, 'with': 2, 'another': 1, 'runs': 2, 'to': 12, 'place': 1, 'abandoned': 1, 'next': 2, '’s': 2, 'kid': 1, 'However': 1, 'she': 3, 'realises': 3, 'it': 3, 'has': 3, 'keep': 2, 'for': 1, 'himself': 1, ' ': 2, '<': 2, 'br/': 2, '>': 2, 'After': 1, 'that': 1, 'decides': 2, 'leave': 1, 'again': 2, 'but': 1, 'police': 1, 'officer': 1, 'catches': 1, 'doing': 1, 'Next': 1, 'gives': 2, 'an': 2, 'old': 2, 'man': 2, 'starts': 1, 'running': 1, 'away': 1, 'The': 2, 'very': 1, 'same': 1, 'woman': 1, 'whom': 1, 'was': 1, 'given': 1, 'before': 1, 'moment': 1, 'her': 2, 'so': 2, 'just': 2, 'catch': 1, 'hits': 1, 'in': 1, 'head': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'does': 1, 'not': 1, 'know': 1, 'what': 1, 'do': 1, 'anymore': 1, 'sits': 1, 'holding': 1, 'piece': 1, 'paper': 1, 'hidden': 1, 'between': 1, 'reads': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'boy': 1, 'brave': 1, 'take': 1, 'care': 1}	{'NUM': 1, 'NOUN': 38, 'PUNCT': 27, 'PROPN': 7, 'AUX': 9, 'VERB': 44, 'ADP': 20, 'DET': 26, 'CCONJ': 11, 'PRON': 35, 'ADJ': 9, 'ADV': 17, 'SCONJ': 1, 'PART': 11, 'SPACE': 2, 'X': 4}

He is not having a good day: things fall from above him, and when he tries to smoke he realises he doesn't have that much cigarrettes. He suddenly founds a little baby in the middle of the street. Who could he belong to? He picks it up and decides that a lady who is walking in the street close to him must be her mother o a good stepmother, since she already has one in his baby car. The lady doesn't want the baby, hence he decides to leave it in the same place he found him. In the right moment he's leaving him, a policeman arrives, looks to him, and Charlie has no other option than pick up the abandoned kid... again. Later on, the tried to give the baby to a beggar in the street, but failed, so he tried again with the lady he met in the first place, but the lady still doesn't want a kid that is not hers and gets really angry at him, she even beats him with her handbad. After being furiously hitted by the lady, the policeman arrives, so Chaplin picks up the baby again. He hasn't a clue about what to do with the kid, he even is thinking about to leave it in the underground. At that moment he founds out that there's a note in the baby: her mother ask whoever find his baby to please keep him. So it seems that Charlie has no choice: he takes the kid with him and walk away.

The first man runs to avoid being hit and, while he was smoking he suddenly finds a baby next to a wall. He does not know what to do and, luckily for him, a woman was passing by behind him so he gives the baby to her, but she gets angry. Then, the man decides to leave the baby in the same place he found him but a policeman sees the scene, so the man can not abandon the baby. This time, a man with a beard was walking near him, so the man gives the baby to him and runs away, but that man also gives the baby to the same woman as the other man. When the man thinks he is safe, he goes to the street, but the woman, who thought that he has left the baby again to her, gets mad and starts hitting him. The policeman appears again and the man picks the baby and goes away. Finally, he finds a letter with the baby asking for love and decides to keep the baby		{'A': 1, 'man': 10, 'is': 2, 'passing': 2, 'by': 2, 'near': 2, 'a': 9, 'building': 1, 'and': 8, 'another': 1, 'one': 1, 'drops': 1, 'boxes': 1, 'from': 1, 'window': 1, '.': 7, 'The': 2, 'first': 1, 'runs': 2, 'to': 10, 'avoid': 1, 'being': 1, 'hit': 1, ',': 14, 'while': 1, 'he': 8, 'was': 3, 'smoking': 1, 'suddenly': 1, 'finds': 2, 'baby': 10, 'next': 1, 'wall': 1, 'He': 1, 'does': 1, 'not': 2, 'know': 1, 'what': 1, 'do': 1, 'luckily': 1, 'for': 2, 'him': 6, 'woman': 3, 'behind': 1, 'so': 3, 'gives': 3, 'the': 20, 'her': 2, 'but': 4, 'she': 1, 'gets': 2, 'angry': 1, 'Then': 1, 'decides': 2, 'leave': 1, 'in': 1, 'same': 2, 'place': 1, 'found': 1, 'policeman': 2, 'sees': 1, 'scene': 1, 'can': 1, 'abandon': 1, 'This': 1, 'time': 1, 'with': 2, 'beard': 1, 'walking': 1, 'away': 2, 'that': 2, 'also': 1, 'as': 1, 'other': 1, 'When': 1, 'thinks': 1, 'safe': 1, 'goes': 2, 'street': 1, 'who': 1, 'thought': 1, 'has': 1, 'left': 1, 'again': 2, 'mad': 1, 'starts': 1, 'hitting': 1, 'appears': 1, 'picks': 1, 'Finally': 1, 'letter': 1, 'asking': 1, 'love': 1, 'keep': 1}	{'DET': 35, 'NOUN': 37, 'AUX': 9, 'VERB': 35, 'ADV': 14, 'ADP': 16, 'CCONJ': 12, 'PUNCT': 21, 'ADJ': 7, 'PART': 6, 'SCONJ': 4, 'PRON': 20}

The main character is rolled by Charles Chaplin, one of the best actors in black and white films. The story starts when Chaplin finds the baby crying on the floor behind a paper bin. Obviously, he takes the baby and tries to calm him or her. However, after a while, he realizes that people are going to say that it’s his baby, and he tries to put in a baby carriage of a foreign woman that was buying in a supermarket. The woman realizes what he has done just in the last moment, and she gives the baby back to him. Then, he tries the same experiment with a poor man that was also walking down the street, but this time he hides behind a wall, and the poor man puts again the baby in the baby carriage of the foreign lady. Unfortunately, when the woman realizes that the baby is in her baby carriage again, Chaplin is just walking near her, and she runs after him to hit him with her umbrella and returns him back. Finally, Chaplin decides to take care of the baby, he writes something on a paper, and the story ends with him seated on the ground.		{'The': 4, 'story': 3, 'of': 5, 'this': 2, 'video': 1, 'is': 5, 'about': 1, 'a': 10, 'man': 3, 'who': 1, 'finds': 2, 'lost': 1, 'baby': 11, 'in': 7, 'the': 19, 'street': 3, 'and': 9, 'tries': 4, 'to': 8, 'give': 1, 'him': 7, 'or': 2, 'her': 5, 'every': 1, 'person': 1, 'that': 6, 'walking': 3, 'down': 2, '.': 9, 'main': 1, 'character': 1, 'rolled': 1, 'by': 1, 'Charles': 1, 'Chaplin': 4, ',': 15, 'one': 1, 'best': 1, 'actors': 1, 'black': 1, 'white': 1, 'films': 1, 'starts': 1, 'when': 2, 'crying': 1, 'on': 3, 'floor': 1, 'behind': 2, 'paper': 2, 'bin': 1, 'Obviously': 1, 'he': 7, 'takes': 1, 'calm': 1, 'However': 1, 'after': 2, 'while': 1, 'realizes': 3, 'people': 1, 'are': 1, 'going': 1, 'say': 1, 'it': 1, '’s': 1, 'his': 1, 'put': 1, 'carriage': 3, 'foreign': 2, 'woman': 3, 'was': 2, 'buying': 1, 'supermarket': 1, 'what': 1, 'has': 1, 'done': 1, 'just': 2, 'last': 1, 'moment': 1, 'she': 2, 'gives': 1, 'back': 2, 'Then': 1, 'same': 1, 'experiment': 1, 'with': 3, 'poor': 2, 'also': 1, 'but': 1, 'time': 1, 'hides': 1, 'wall': 1, 'puts': 1, 'again': 2, 'lady': 1, 'Unfortunately': 1, 'near': 1, 'runs': 1, 'hit': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'returns': 1, 'Finally': 1, 'decides': 1, 'take': 1, 'care': 1, 'writes': 1, 'something': 1, 'ends': 1, 'seated': 1, 'ground': 1}	{'DET': 36, 'NOUN': 46, 'ADP': 28, 'AUX': 9, 'PRON': 29, 'VERB': 35, 'ADJ': 11, 'CCONJ': 12, 'PART': 6, 'PUNCT': 24, 'PROPN': 5, 'NUM': 1, 'SCONJ': 6, 'ADV': 12}

When Chaplin stops walking to smoke a cigarette, he finds a little baby laying alone on the floor. He picks him up and starts looking around in case the parents of the baby are nearby. In that moment, a woman appears with a trolley and another baby and Chaplin thinks she may be the mother, so he addresses her to give her the baby back. However, the woman says the baby is not hers. Chaplin decides to leave the baby where he found it, but a policeman is standing behind him, so he cannot abandon the baby. Chaplin leaves the place holding the little baby and then, he finds an old man walking. As Chaplin does not want to keep the baby, he gives the orphan child to the man and runs away very quickly. The man tries to follow him, but Chaplin hides himself in a house and, since the man cannot walk properly and moves slowly, he cannot find Chaplin. Therefore, the old man leaves the baby in a trolley he finds on the street and runs away. In the following scene, the previous woman appears again and finds the orphan child in her trolley with her child. Then, Chaplin appears walking, the woman sees him and she starts hitting him to make him take the baby. The argue because Chaplin does not want to take the orphan, so they begin to fight. In that moment, the policeman appears and Chaplin has to take the baby with him. Later on, Chaplin sits on the pavement, looks at the child and discovers a note within the baby's clothes. The note says: Love and care for this orphan child. He smiles and goes away holding the baby, probably indicating that he is going to do so.

Some trash finally is dropped on him. As a result, he stops and prepares himself a cigarette. Then, he throws his gloves in the bin. What happens next makes him feel confused: he finds a baby on the floor. As a woman comes by with a baby buggy, Charles Chaplin thinks that the baby might have fallen out of it, so he puts him on it with the other child, but the woman gets angry with him and tells him to take his kid and stay away from them. Later, Chaplin tries to return the baby to where he found him, however, as a policeman is watching him, he has to take the kid again with him. Then, Chaplin attempts to leave the child with an old man by faking that he has to tie his shoes and running afterwards. Nevertheless, the old man leaves the child on a baby buggy he founds, which is that from the woman that appeared on the previous scene. When she notices the new baby and identifies Chaplin on the street, she attacks him with her umbrella and makes him take the unknown child with him again. Meanwhile, the policeman observes them. Later, he thinks about leaving the child in a sewer, but refuses the idea and, when he does, he finds a letter inside the baby clothes and discovers that it is an orphan kid. Finally, he decides to keep the baby with him and leaves.		{'While': 1, 'Charles': 2, 'Chaplin': 5, 'is': 5, 'walking': 1, 'down': 1, 'the': 22, 'street': 2, ',': 20, 'people': 1, 'throw': 1, 'rubbish': 1, 'out': 2, 'of': 2, 'windows': 1, '.': 13, 'Some': 1, 'trash': 1, 'finally': 1, 'dropped': 1, 'on': 6, 'him': 12, 'As': 2, 'a': 9, 'result': 1, 'he': 12, 'stops': 1, 'and': 9, 'prepares': 1, 'himself': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'Then': 2, 'throws': 1, 'his': 3, 'gloves': 1, 'in': 2, 'bin': 1, 'What': 1, 'happens': 1, 'next': 1, 'makes': 2, 'feel': 1, 'confused': 1, ':': 1, 'finds': 2, 'baby': 8, 'floor': 1, 'woman': 3, 'comes': 1, 'by': 2, 'with': 8, 'buggy': 2, 'thinks': 2, 'that': 5, 'might': 1, 'have': 1, 'fallen': 1, 'it': 3, 'so': 1, 'puts': 1, 'other': 1, 'child': 5, 'but': 2, 'gets': 1, 'angry': 1, 'tells': 1, 'to': 7, 'take': 3, 'kid': 3, 'stay': 1, 'away': 1, 'from': 2, 'them': 2, 'Later': 2, 'tries': 1, 'return': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'however': 1, 'as': 1, 'policeman': 2, 'watching': 1, 'has': 2, 'again': 2, 'attempts': 1, 'leave': 1, 'an': 2, 'old': 2, 'man': 2, 'faking': 1, 'tie': 1, 'shoes': 1, 'running': 1, 'afterwards': 1, 'Nevertheless': 1, 'leaves': 2, 'founds': 1, 'which': 1, 'appeared': 1, 'previous': 1, 'scene': 1, 'When': 1, 'she': 2, 'notices': 1, 'new': 1, 'identifies': 1, 'attacks': 1, 'her': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'unknown': 1, 'Meanwhile': 1, 'observes': 1, 'about': 1, 'leaving': 1, 'sewer': 1, 'refuses': 1, 'idea': 1, 'when': 1, 'does': 1, 'letter': 1, 'inside': 1, 'clothes': 1, 'discovers': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'Finally': 1, 'decides': 1, 'keep': 1}	{'SCONJ': 9, 'PROPN': 7, 'AUX': 7, 'VERB': 47, 'ADP': 28, 'DET': 34, 'NOUN': 43, 'PUNCT': 34, 'ADV': 16, 'PRON': 40, 'CCONJ': 11, 'ADJ': 10, 'PART': 6}

Finally, Chaplin takes the baby again from the carriage and walks away.  <br/> A police officer approaches and stares at him inquisitively. Chaplin goes away because he doesn't want any problems with the authority.

Chaplin	written_online	70.0	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (Spanish/English)	This video starts with some bricks falling from what seems to be a cantiere. Chaplin, who is under it, goes away from. With his typical way of walking, he starts to smoke. As he goes into the nearest part of the scene to us: he makes sure that his walking stick is flexible enough, he recolocates his hat when suddenly some rubbish falls from the sky so he gets dirty. He swears. <br/>  <br/>  When he arrives to that part of the scene, he looks at the rubbish bin and also finds out that he only has one cigarette left, which he puts in his mouth. He puts off his gloves and starts a fire with the sole and the match in order to turn on the cigarette. He throws away the match and, as he doesn’t know where he can put his gloves, he throws them to the bin. He shakes his hands and as his is smoking he discovers a baby wrapped in a blanket. He cannot really believe it. He looks up several as he was trying to find out how did the baby had got in there. He looks again to the baby and he takes it as a woman with a stroller is passing by just right behind him. <br/>  <br/>  He looks up again and is when he looks down again when he realises that there is a  woman that has just left the stroller in the street while she has got into a shop. The baby might be hers. He tries to call her attention but as it wasn’t successful he goes to the stroller (where there is another baby) and puts the unknown baby inside. <br/> When the woman comes out she finds out that a stranger (Chaplin) is putting a baby into her stroller. He tells the woman that she has dropped something (something-> the baby) but the woman does not seem to share his opinion. She starts shouting at Chaplin so he has to take the baby again as the woman leaves with the stroller (in the scene of taking again the baby he nearly took the baby that is not the unknown one).  <br/>  <br/> As he cannot take care of him he decides to put the baby again where he found it. He puts it in the floor again but he realised that a police officer was just behind him so takes again the baby and goes away while looking at the police officer. He gets into a different street and he finds an old man walking with a walking stick. Chaplin asks the old man to hold for a minute the baby because he has to tie up his shoelaces. He fakes the action of tiying and when the old man is not looking he runs away. When the old man realises, he also starts to walk quickly after him. <br/>  <br/> Now we are again in the first scenario where we can see Chaplin hiding in a kind of streetwardrove. We see again the old man running with the baby and trying to find Chaplin satisfactorily. However, the old man finds the previous stroller without (the woman is not there) so he decides to put the baby in there and run away.  <br/>  <br/> As Chaplin gets out of his hiding place, the police officer is having a walk over there and finds out that Chaplin is there. When Chaplin sees him he goes just the other way round.  <br/>  <br/> We can see again the stroller with the two babies while some men are passing by. But, is Chaplin the one who is passing by when the woman gets out of the shop and realises that there are, again, two babies. She sees Chaplin so she takes her umbrella and starts running after Chaplin. When she is near enough she kicks him with the umbrella. She also throws him to the floor and kicks him several times when he gets up. She takes him to the stroller in order to him to take away the baby. The police officer, who his walking around hears the noise so he goes to where they are arguing. The woman seems to be very upset and explains to the police officer in a really effusive way what happened. Chaplin tries also to convince the police officer but he realises there is nothing to do with it so he takes again the baby. He goes away, also the woman does and the only one who stays in the place is the police officer who waits several seconds before leaving the scene.  <br/>  <br/> Now, we can see Chaplin again. He is standing up looking around, like he was wondering what to do. He sighs, he changes the baby’s position and he sits in the sidewalk. When he is sat down he puts away his walking stick. Just right him there is sewer which he opens, looks at the baby and he seems to be about putting the baby overthere but he changes opinion and closes the sewer. He looks several times at the baby, he changes again the position of the baby and he licks his fingers because it looks like the baby has bitten him.  <br/> He looks inside the baby’s blanket and finds out that there is a paper. He recolocates the lapel of his jacket and he starts reading it. It is a white note where it is written “Please love and care for this orphan child”. Chaplin looks again at the baby, with love, and puts the note inside his jacket while he keeps looking at the baby.  <br/>  <br/> Chaplin smiles, holds harder to the child, takes his walking stick and stands up. He changes direction and starts walking away.		{'This': 1, 'video': 1, 'starts': 8, 'with': 10, 'some': 3, 'bricks': 1, 'falling': 1, 'from': 3, 'what': 3, 'seems': 3, 'to': 30, 'be': 4, 'a': 19, 'cantiere': 1, '.': 51, 'Chaplin': 16, ',': 25, 'who': 5, 'is': 24, 'under': 1, 'it': 10, 'goes': 7, 'away': 9, 'With': 1, 'his': 17, 'typical': 1, 'way': 3, 'of': 11, 'walking': 8, 'he': 46, 'smoke': 1, 'As': 3, 'into': 4, 'the': 78, 'nearest': 1, 'part': 2, 'scene': 4, 'us': 1, ':': 1, 'makes': 1, 'sure': 1, 'that': 12, 'stick': 4, 'flexible': 1, 'enough': 2, 'recolocates': 2, 'hat': 1, 'when': 6, 'suddenly': 1, 'rubbish': 2, 'falls': 1, 'sky': 1, 'so': 7, 'gets': 5, 'dirty': 1, 'He': 20, 'swears': 1, '<': 18, 'br/': 18, '>': 19, ' ': 17, 'When': 6, 'arrives': 1, 'looks': 10, 'at': 7, 'bin': 2, 'and': 29, 'also': 5, 'finds': 6, 'out': 8, 'only': 2, 'has': 7, 'one': 4, 'cigarette': 2, 'left': 2, 'which': 2, 'puts': 6, 'in': 14, 'mouth': 1, 'off': 1, 'gloves': 2, 'fire': 1, 'sole': 1, 'match': 2, 'order': 2, 'turn': 1, 'on': 1, 'throws': 3, 'as': 6, 'does': 3, 'n’t': 2, 'know': 1, 'where': 6, 'can': 6, 'put': 3, 'them': 1, 'shakes': 1, 'hands': 1, 'smoking': 1, 'discovers': 1, 'baby': 27, 'wrapped': 1, 'blanket': 2, 'not': 6, 'really': 2, 'believe': 1, 'up': 6, 'several': 4, 'was': 4, 'trying': 2, 'find': 2, 'how': 1, 'did': 1, 'had': 1, 'got': 2, 'there': 11, 'again': 16, 'takes': 6, 'woman': 10, 'stroller': 8, 'passing': 3, 'by': 3, 'just': 4, 'right': 2, 'behind': 2, 'him': 12, 'down': 2, 'realises': 4, 'street': 2, 'while': 4, 'she': 6, 'shop': 2, 'The': 3, 'might': 1, 'hers': 1, 'tries': 2, 'call': 1, 'her': 3, 'attention': 1, 'but': 5, 'successful': 1, '(': 5, 'another': 1, ')': 5, 'unknown': 2, 'inside': 3, 'comes': 1, 'stranger': 1, 'putting': 2, 'tells': 1, 'dropped': 1, 'something': 1, 'something-': 1, 'seem': 1, 'share': 1, 'opinion': 2, 'She': 4, 'shouting': 1, 'take': 3, 'leaves': 1, 'taking': 1, 'nearly': 1, 'took': 1, 'care': 2, 'decides': 2, 'found': 1, 'floor': 2, 'realised': 1, 'police': 7, 'officer': 7, 'looking': 4, 'different': 1, 'an': 1, 'old': 6, 'man': 6, 'asks': 1, 'hold': 1, 'for': 2, 'minute': 1, 'because': 2, 'tie': 1, 'shoelaces': 1, 'fakes': 1, 'action': 1, 'tiying': 1, 'runs': 1, 'walk': 2, 'quickly': 1, 'after': 2, 'Now': 2, 'we': 3, 'are': 4, 'first': 1, 'scenario': 1, 'see': 4, 'hiding': 2, 'kind': 1, 'streetwardrove': 1, 'We': 2, 'running': 2, 'satisfactorily': 1, 'However': 1, 'previous': 1, 'without': 1, 'run': 1, 'place': 2, 'having': 1, 'over': 1, 'sees': 2, 'other': 1, 'round': 1, 'two': 2, 'babies': 2, 'men': 1, 'But': 1, 'umbrella': 2, 'near': 1, 'kicks': 2, 'times': 2, 'around': 2, 'hears': 1, 'noise': 1, 'they': 1, 'arguing': 1, 'very': 1, 'upset': 1, 'explains': 1, 'effusive': 1, 'happened': 1, 'convince': 1, 'nothing': 1, 'do': 2, 'stays': 1, 'waits': 1, 'seconds': 1, 'before': 1, 'leaving': 1, 'standing': 1, 'like': 2, 'wondering': 1, 'sighs': 1, 'changes': 4, '’s': 2, 'position': 2, 'sits': 1, 'sidewalk': 1, 'sat': 1, 'Just': 1, 'sewer': 2, 'opens': 1, 'about': 1, 'overthere': 1, 'closes': 1, 'licks': 1, 'fingers': 1, 'bitten': 1, 'paper': 1, 'lapel': 1, 'jacket': 2, 'reading': 1, 'It': 1, 'white': 1, 'note': 2, 'written': 1, '“': 1, 'Please': 1, 'love': 2, 'this': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'child': 2, '”': 1, 'keeps': 1, 'smiles': 1, 'holds': 1, 'harder': 1, 'stands': 1, 'direction': 1}	{'DET': 108, 'NOUN': 154, 'VERB': 176, 'ADP': 90, 'PRON': 149, 'PART': 29, 'AUX': 46, 'PUNCT': 89, 'PROPN': 33, 'ADV': 70, 'ADJ': 27, 'SCONJ': 46, 'CCONJ': 36, 'X': 38, 'SPACE': 17, 'NUM': 5, 'INTJ': 1}

The lady, angry, gives him back to Chaplin that tries to fool another man in order to make him keep the baby. But the man puts the baby again in the stroller of the lady, that thinks it was Chaplin again the one who did it. She hits him with her umbrella and tells the policeman.

Also, I can see that some pieces of brick are falling from a building. Then, he founds a baby next to a container. This baby is alone and Chaplin cannot see the baby's mother around there. Next, he finds a woman with her baby, so he may think that she is the mother of the baby he has already found. However, she is not the person he is looking for. After that, he returns to the place where he has found the baby previously to leave him/her there. Unfortunately, I can see a policeman near the place where Chaplin is and I guess that this policeman thinks that Chaplin is trying to abandon the baby right there. For this reason, Chaplin does not leave the bay there and continues walking. Next, he encounters a man and Chaplin asks him to take care of the baby while he is doing something with his shoes. In this moment, Chaplin starts running because he does not know what he could do with the orphan baby. Based on this, I believe that Chaplin tries to leave the man he finds on the street with the baby to avoid himself some problems. Nevertheless, he has to take care of the baby again. <br/> Chaplin sees again the baby that the mother was carrying with herself previously, so that he tries again to leave the baby with this woman again, but he fails. <br/> Finally, he sits down and reads a paper that he finds inside the clothes of the baby. Someone has written a message for the person that would find the baby: ""love and take care of this orphan baby""."

Then, the figure of Chaplin shows up trying to find a cigarette and then lighting it. Just a few moment later, he finds a baby hidden between the trash. He starts to look for someone to look after the baby: he first goes after a woman with another baby and second, a man he finds walking peacefully; not to mention the police following him for his suspicious actions towards the baby. Although, no matter what he does, the baby ends up in his hands. At the end, Chaplin does not know what else to do and sits. He finds out a note between the baby's clothes explaining that the baby is orphan. After reading the note, Chaplin stands up with the baby and walks away.

Chaplin	written_online	15.0	Inside classroom	Spellchecker	The video shows Chaplin walking by the streets when he suddenly finds an abandoned baby behind the trash can. Then, he grabs the baby and runs into a woman pushing a baby carriage who seems to have lost something. Chaplin approaches the woman and leaves the baby inside the carriage but she refuses immediately since that baby is not hers. Chaplin, confused, grabs the baby again and leaves the woman behind. He thinks that leaving the baby in the same place he found him/her would be the solution, but a policeman appears making Chaplin to stop his attempt to abandon the baby and leaves. On his way, he encounters a man asking him to hold the baby while he pretends to tie his shoes and starts running. Everything was just fine for Chaplin, but little did he spect that the man would place the baby on the same baby carriage he tried before. Unfortunately, Chaplin walks through the same street where the woman mentioned before was and when she sees him she starts hitting Caplin with an umbrella claiming that he was the one who place the baby inside again. The policeman shows during the argument and Chaplin has to take the baby with him again. Chaplin is really frustrated and upset about the situation, he has to take care of a baby that is not his own, but suddenly he grabs a hand-written note asking to love and care the orphan baby. Hence, Chaplin, due to the moving note, decides to keep the baby with him.		{'The': 2, 'video': 1, 'shows': 2, 'Chaplin': 9, 'walking': 1, 'by': 1, 'the': 26, 'streets': 1, 'when': 2, 'he': 10, 'suddenly': 2, 'finds': 1, 'an': 2, 'abandoned': 1, 'baby': 16, 'behind': 2, 'trash': 1, 'can': 1, '.': 11, 'Then': 1, ',': 12, 'grabs': 3, 'and': 9, 'runs': 1, 'into': 1, 'a': 6, 'woman': 4, 'pushing': 1, 'carriage': 3, 'who': 2, 'seems': 1, 'to': 10, 'have': 1, 'lost': 1, 'something': 1, 'approaches': 1, 'leaves': 3, 'inside': 2, 'but': 4, 'she': 3, 'refuses': 1, 'immediately': 1, 'since': 1, 'that': 5, 'is': 3, 'not': 2, 'hers': 1, 'confused': 1, 'again': 3, 'He': 1, 'thinks': 1, 'leaving': 1, 'in': 1, 'same': 3, 'place': 3, 'found': 1, 'him': 5, '/': 1, 'her': 1, 'would': 2, 'be': 1, 'solution': 1, 'policeman': 2, 'appears': 1, 'making': 1, 'stop': 1, 'his': 4, 'attempt': 1, 'abandon': 1, 'On': 1, 'way': 1, 'encounters': 1, 'man': 2, 'asking': 2, 'hold': 1, 'while': 1, 'pretends': 1, 'tie': 1, 'shoes': 1, 'starts': 2, 'running': 1, 'Everything': 1, 'was': 3, 'just': 1, 'fine': 1, 'for': 1, 'little': 1, 'did': 1, 'spect': 1, 'on': 1, 'tried': 1, 'before': 2, 'Unfortunately': 1, 'walks': 1, 'through': 1, 'street': 1, 'where': 1, 'mentioned': 1, 'sees': 1, 'hitting': 1, 'Caplin': 1, 'with': 3, 'umbrella': 1, 'claiming': 1, 'one': 1, 'during': 1, 'argument': 1, 'has': 2, 'take': 2, 'really': 1, 'frustrated': 1, 'upset': 1, 'about': 1, 'situation': 1, 'care': 2, 'of': 1, 'own': 1, 'hand': 1, '-': 1, 'written': 1, 'note': 2, 'love': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'Hence': 1, 'due': 1, 'moving': 1, 'decides': 1, 'keep': 1}	{'DET': 37, 'NOUN': 47, 'VERB': 51, 'PROPN': 10, 'ADP': 17, 'SCONJ': 8, 'PRON': 29, 'ADV': 15, 'PUNCT': 24, 'CCONJ': 13, 'PART': 10, 'AUX': 12, 'ADJ': 9, 'SYM': 1, 'NUM': 1}

He does not seem much bothered and takes off his gloves and ligths up a cigar. He later throw his gloves to the rubbish bin.  <br/> At some point, he saw a baby in a corner of the street, right behind another bin, and hold him up to see him more clearly. Then, he sees a woman with another child and thinks that she might have lost that baby so he places him on the baby carriage. The woman seems upset by this reaction because it is not her baby and hits Chaplin to show her anger and make him go away. As a result, Chaplin goes again to the corner where he found the baby, in order to put him where he was found. However, a policeman saw him and angrily told him not to do so, which makes Chaplin move to another street, where he finds a man and, pretending that he has to tie her shoelaces, he tricks the man to get rid of the baby and leaving him in the arms of this man. This person, in another street, sees a baby carriage and decides to place the baby there in order to get rid of him. However, the woman, when she comes out of the grocery shop, sees Chaplin walking down the street and, again, hits him to show her annoance and make him go back to the carriage and take the baby again.  <br/> With the baby in his arms, Chaplin is confused and tired. He does not know what to do with the baby. He even thought about placing him in the drain. Nevertheless, he finds a note in the baby clothes. It is written to please love and take of that orphan child. Chaplin, at this point, feels the responsability to do so and decides to keep the baby.		{'Chaplin': 8, 'comes': 2, 'out': 3, '.': 17, 'Neighbours': 1, 'are': 1, 'throwing': 1, 'rubbish': 2, 'of': 7, 'the': 21, 'window': 1, 'and': 17, 'is': 4, 'falling': 1, 'on': 2, 'He': 4, 'does': 2, 'not': 4, 'seem': 1, 'much': 1, 'bothered': 1, 'takes': 1, 'off': 1, 'his': 3, 'gloves': 2, 'ligths': 1, 'up': 2, 'a': 9, 'cigar': 1, 'later': 1, 'throw': 1, 'to': 17, 'bin': 2, ' ': 2, '<': 2, 'br/': 2, '>': 2, 'At': 1, 'some': 1, 'point': 2, ',': 22, 'he': 9, 'saw': 2, 'baby': 13, 'in': 8, 'corner': 2, 'street': 4, 'right': 1, 'behind': 1, 'another': 4, 'hold': 1, 'him': 12, 'see': 1, 'more': 1, 'clearly': 1, 'Then': 1, 'sees': 3, 'woman': 3, 'with': 2, 'child': 2, 'thinks': 1, 'that': 4, 'she': 2, 'might': 1, 'have': 1, 'lost': 1, 'so': 3, 'places': 1, 'carriage': 3, 'The': 1, 'seems': 1, 'upset': 1, 'by': 1, 'this': 3, 'reaction': 1, 'because': 1, 'it': 1, 'her': 4, 'hits': 2, 'show': 2, 'anger': 1, 'make': 2, 'go': 2, 'away': 1, 'As': 1, 'result': 1, 'goes': 1, 'again': 3, 'where': 3, 'found': 2, 'order': 2, 'put': 1, 'was': 1, 'However': 2, 'policeman': 1, 'angrily': 1, 'told': 1, 'do': 3, 'which': 1, 'makes': 1, 'move': 1, 'finds': 2, 'man': 3, 'pretending': 1, 'has': 1, 'tie': 1, 'shoelaces': 1, 'tricks': 1, 'get': 2, 'rid': 2, 'leaving': 1, 'arms': 2, 'This': 1, 'person': 1, 'decides': 2, 'place': 1, 'there': 1, 'when': 1, 'grocery': 1, 'shop': 1, 'walking': 1, 'down': 1, 'annoance': 1, 'back': 1, 'take': 2, 'With': 1, 'confused': 1, 'tired': 1, 'know': 1, 'what': 1, 'even': 1, 'thought': 1, 'about': 1, 'placing': 1, 'drain': 1, 'Nevertheless': 1, 'note': 1, 'clothes': 1, 'It': 1, 'written': 1, 'please': 1, 'love': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'at': 1, 'feels': 1, 'responsability': 1, 'keep': 1}	{'PROPN': 12, 'VERB': 60, 'ADP': 37, 'PUNCT': 39, 'NOUN': 57, 'AUX': 13, 'DET': 42, 'CCONJ': 17, 'PRON': 38, 'PART': 17, 'ADV': 19, 'SPACE': 2, 'X': 4, 'SCONJ': 8, 'ADJ': 3}

In that moment, a woman appears and the man thinks she's the kid's mum. He introduces the baby in the baby stroller the woman is carrying with another baby in it, and pretends he has nothing to do with the child.  <br/> The woman gets angry when she realizes there's a baby next to hers because she has seen the man walking around them and suspects he is the one who has brought that new kid. That's why she starts shouting and tells the man to take the baby.  <br/> The man obeys and starts looking for another person to leave the child with. He finds a man wandering, gives him the baby, and runs away. Again, the wanderer doesn't know what to do with the baby, and decides to leave him in the baby stroller of the woman already mentioned. He runs away too.  <br/> However, unluckily, the first man walks around the woman and she thinks he has put the baby next to hers again.

Suddenly, a pile of leaves falls on him, extinguishing his cigarette. Once he lights it again, he discovers a baby behind a barrel. Charles starts looking around for his parents, when suddenly a lady with a stroller passes by and he deduces that the baby is hers. Once he puts the baby in it, the woman notices and gets very angry with him. Charles then decides to leave the baby in the same place where he found him. However, a policeman appears and he prefers to take the baby back to avoid any trouble. Later, he meets an older man and asks him to hold the baby while he ties his shoes. Once he agrees, Charles runs away and hides, willing to get rid of the baby. The older man, without knowing what to do, leaves the baby in the same stroller as before. The woman with the stroller, on leaving the shop, discovers that the baby has been put back there. Just then, Charles crosses her path and the woman, again very upset, hits him with her umbrella. After that, he sits down on the pavement with the baby, and thinks for a moment about putting the baby down a sewer. At that moment, however, he discovers a note among the baby's blankets, asking for the orphaned baby to be taken care of. Finally, moved by the story, it seems that Charles is going to keep the baby.

Charles Chaplin walks past besides the woman, so she picks up an umbrella and hits him because she thinks he wants to abandone the baby. The policeman appears again, as a consequence, he takes the baby and runs away. He is pretty tired, so he sits down on the pavement embracing the baby and suddenly a note appears from the baby's clothes. Someone asks the person who finds the baby to take care of him because he has no one in this life. Finally, Charles Chapñin stands up and starts walking with the little baby in his hands.

He looks around and realizes that there is an abandonned baby in the street. He picks him up and thinks that the baby is the son of a woman who is carryin a buggy with another baby. He leaves the kid in there, but the woman says it is not hers. He then tries to abandon the baby, but a cop is watching him, so he picks it up again. He then sees a man and asking him to hold the baby while he ties his shoes, he runs away. That man finds the woman and leaves the baby again with her, and Chaplin passes near. The cop is there, and the woman hits Charles and tells the cop that he is abandonning the baby. Chaplin has to take him with him and finds a note saying that the baby must be loved and taken care of, so he finally keeps it.		{'Charles': 2, 'Chaplin': 3, 'is': 8, 'going': 1, 'for': 1, 'a': 6, 'walk': 1, 'when': 1, 'something': 1, 'hits': 2, 'him': 6, 'in': 3, 'the': 14, 'head': 1, '.': 9, 'He': 5, 'looks': 1, 'around': 1, 'and': 9, 'realizes': 1, 'that': 4, 'there': 3, 'an': 1, 'abandonned': 1, 'baby': 8, 'street': 1, 'picks': 2, 'up': 2, 'thinks': 1, 'son': 1, 'of': 2, 'woman': 4, 'who': 1, 'carryin': 1, 'buggy': 1, 'with': 3, 'another': 1, 'leaves': 2, 'kid': 1, ',': 7, 'but': 2, 'says': 1, 'it': 3, 'not': 1, 'hers': 1, 'then': 2, 'tries': 1, 'to': 3, 'abandon': 1, 'cop': 3, 'watching': 1, 'so': 2, 'he': 5, 'again': 2, 'sees': 1, 'man': 2, 'asking': 1, 'hold': 1, 'while': 1, 'ties': 1, 'his': 1, 'shoes': 1, 'runs': 1, 'away': 1, 'That': 1, 'finds': 2, 'her': 1, 'passes': 1, 'near': 1, 'The': 1, 'tells': 1, 'abandonning': 1, 'has': 1, 'take': 1, 'note': 1, 'saying': 1, 'must': 1, 'be': 1, 'loved': 1, 'taken': 1, 'care': 1, 'finally': 1, 'keeps': 1}	{'PROPN': 6, 'AUX': 9, 'VERB': 31, 'ADP': 11, 'DET': 24, 'NOUN': 27, 'SCONJ': 6, 'PRON': 24, 'PUNCT': 16, 'ADV': 12, 'CCONJ': 11, 'ADJ': 1, 'PART': 4}

Chaplin	written_online	25.0	Outside classroom		The short film is about a man who found a baby left on the pavement. The more he tried to get away from him, the more difficult it was. Firstly, he bumped into a woman who was walking there with a baby carriage. Then, he left the baby in the carriage as if the left baby had been forgotten by the woman. After being rejected by the woman, he thought about leaving the kid on the pavement again, but when he realised a policeman was looking at them, he took the baby and got around as if nothing had happened. Then, he deceived a old man who was having a walk. The old man was given the baby and Charles ran away. By the time he thought he had get away with it, he bumped into the lady whom he had tried to deceive before. Eventually, he was forced to have the baby. The last scene consists of Charles Chaplin sit on the pavement with the kid on his lap. He read a label the kid had, where it had been written down that the baby was an orphan kid.		{'The': 4, 'short': 1, 'film': 1, 'is': 1, 'about': 2, 'a': 8, 'man': 3, 'who': 3, 'found': 1, 'baby': 8, 'left': 3, 'on': 4, 'the': 18, 'pavement': 3, '.': 11, 'more': 2, 'he': 12, 'tried': 2, 'to': 3, 'get': 2, 'away': 3, 'from': 1, 'him': 1, ',': 10, 'difficult': 1, 'it': 3, 'was': 7, 'Firstly': 1, 'bumped': 2, 'into': 2, 'woman': 3, 'walking': 1, 'there': 1, 'with': 3, 'carriage': 2, 'Then': 2, 'in': 1, 'as': 2, 'if': 2, 'had': 6, 'been': 2, 'forgotten': 1, 'by': 2, 'After': 1, 'being': 1, 'rejected': 1, 'thought': 2, 'leaving': 1, 'kid': 4, 'again': 1, 'but': 1, 'when': 1, 'realised': 1, 'policeman': 1, 'looking': 1, 'at': 1, 'them': 1, 'took': 1, 'and': 2, 'got': 1, 'around': 1, 'nothing': 1, 'happened': 1, 'deceived': 1, 'old': 2, 'having': 1, 'walk': 1, 'given': 1, 'Charles': 2, 'ran': 1, 'By': 1, 'time': 1, 'lady': 1, 'whom': 1, 'deceive': 1, 'before': 1, 'Eventually': 1, 'forced': 1, 'have': 1, 'last': 1, 'scene': 1, 'consists': 1, 'of': 1, 'Chaplin': 1, 'sit': 1, 'his': 1, 'lap': 1, 'He': 1, 'read': 1, 'label': 1, 'where': 1, 'written': 1, 'down': 1, 'that': 1, 'an': 1, 'orphan': 1}	{'DET': 29, 'ADJ': 6, 'NOUN': 32, 'AUX': 16, 'ADP': 21, 'PRON': 26, 'VERB': 32, 'PUNCT': 21, 'ADV': 12, 'PART': 3, 'SCONJ': 7, 'CCONJ': 3, 'PROPN': 3}

Some of them hit Chaplin on the head and put down the cigarette he's smoking at that moment. He lights another one and then he notices that a baby has been dropped in the middle of an alley. He catches the baby and drops him inside a baby carriage of a woman who is walking down the street with her child. The woman yells at him so he has to take the baby with him. Then he tries to leave the baby where he found it, but a policeman sees him and he catches the baby again. Afterwards he manages to leave the baby to a man who passes by, and that man drops it in the baby carriage of the woman we saw before. The woman thinks Chaplin has done that, and she hits him in the head with her umbrella.

Firstly, Chaplin is walking calmly when suddenly a lot of rubbish falls on him, then Chaplin decides to light a cigarrette with a match. Later, he finds a baby in the middle of the street, he doesn't know what to do so he starts to walk with the baby until he sees a woman with a baby carriage. Chaplin thinks that the baby is likely to belong to that woman so he puts the baby on the carriage but the woman gets angry and she tells him that the baby is not hers. Chaplin comes back to the street and he leaves the baby again on the floor but when he turns around, he bumps into a policeman and as a consequence he picks up the baby again. Chaplin, with a touch of humour, puts the baby on an unkown man's arms and he runs. The unkown man is now confussed but he finds the same carriage in which Chaplin had left the baby before. The man leaves the baby in the carriage like Chaplin and he goes. The upset woman, that has discovered the baby again in her carriage, sees Chaplin taking a walk so she believes that he was the guilty. The woman givesthe baby back to Chaplin. Chaplin, very desperate, doesn't know how to act, he walks with the baby when suddenly, he sees a note among the blankets of the baby, the note says: ''Please love and care for this orphan child''.

He decides to smoke a cigarrete and when he looks down, he discovered a baby crying. First, he thinks one lady has left him there by mistake so he put him in her baby trolley with another baby, but the woman refuses to take him since that was not her baby. After that, he tries, to left him in the same place he found him in the first place, but a policeman catches him and he take the baby back. Thirdly, he tries to left him to an old man. This time, he gets to scape but the old man puts him back into the same trolley so, when Chaplin passes by there, the woman hits him with her umbrella and retuns the baby to him. Finally, desparate, he thinks in leaving the baby in the sewers, but quickly rejects that idea. Then, he discovers a letter in the baby's clothes which says that he is an orphan and please, take care of him, and he does.

At first, he is declared to be an 'ackward ass' because he seemed to fall at the very beginning after someone threw him some clothes. Afterwards, while he was walking, after he lighted himself a cigar, he found an orphan baby lying on the floor. He picked the baby up from the floor and walked to see if he could find the mother of the child. He saw a woman carrying another baby in a trolley so he could have thought this was the baby's mother, so he left the child within the trolley. However, the woman yelled at Chaplin, because she was not the mother and probably she could have guessed that Chaplin wanted to leave the baby with her. As Chaplin is rejected, he followed his path to try to leave the baby again on the floor, but a policeman appears just behind his back, so he decides to pick the baby up again as there would be consequences for him. He walked around desesperately so that he could find the parents, but unsuccessfully, he saw the woman again and decided to put the baby on the  trolley, but the woman discovered him and started kicking him until he fell on the floor.  Finally, he decided to sit down on the road and started to think about leaving the child there, but he read the note on the baby's blanket and thoughtfully, decided to keep the orphan after all.

Then it can be seen that there are various bricks or something similar falling down on him. But, it appear that someone has taken those objects intentionally to disturb the protagonist of the video. However, it can be elucidated that he does not worry. Therefore, he continues his path along the street. While the scene is happening it can be observed that there is a man next to Chaplin and talking to him. The words that the man is uttering are not distinguisable. Moreover, in the scene there are some break downs to show funny sentences commenting about the pictures. I think that in these comments the character tries to express his feelings. He appears to be careless about the missfotunes he is facing. Next, in the setting the main character finds a poor babby that has been left out in the suburbs. He catchs the baby with himand tries to put the baby in a woman's baby-cart. Consequentlu, the girl returns the unknown baby to Chaplin. She does the later with discontent. Following, it can be seen that Chaplin gives the baby to a random man that is near him. In the consequent scene, the same woman that has returned the baby comes to give back again the baby to Chaplin. Finally, Chaplin tries to throw the baby away. Notwithstanding, he finds a note that express the desire to find a person that takes cares of the baby and he decides to by like his father with affection.

The baby is on the floor so he takes the baby in his arms. Behind Chaplin we can see a woman walking with a baby carriage as if she were looking for her baby. Chaplin gets close to the woman and gives her the baby, but he discovers that the woman has a baby already, so the baby that was on the floor is not hers. Chaplin then puts the baby on the floor again but a police officer sees him, so he has to take the baby. Chaplin pretends to have something on his shoe and gives the baby to a passerby. After that, Chaplin runs away. The passerby tries to find Chaplin to give him the baby back, but as he cannot find him, she puts the baby in a carriage with another baby. It was the same carriage as before, so the woman recognizes Chaplin and hits him with an umbrella. Chaplin has to take the bain once more. Chaplin discovers a note that says that the baby is orphan, so he finally seems to love the baby and he keeps him/her.		{'Chaplin': 10, 'is': 4, 'smoking': 1, 'but': 4, 'his': 3, 'cigarette': 1, 'puts': 3, 'out': 1, ',': 10, 'so': 6, 'he': 8, 'lights': 1, 'up': 1, 'another': 2, 'one': 1, '.': 12, 'Suddenly': 1, 'sees': 2, 'a': 8, 'baby': 16, 'crying': 1, 'The': 2, 'on': 4, 'the': 18, 'floor': 3, 'takes': 1, 'in': 2, 'arms': 1, 'Behind': 1, 'we': 1, 'can': 2, 'see': 1, 'woman': 4, 'walking': 1, 'with': 3, 'carriage': 3, 'as': 3, 'if': 1, 'she': 2, 'were': 1, 'looking': 1, 'for': 1, 'her': 3, 'gets': 1, 'close': 1, 'to': 8, 'and': 4, 'gives': 2, 'discovers': 2, 'that': 5, 'has': 3, 'already': 1, 'was': 2, 'not': 2, 'hers': 1, 'then': 1, 'again': 1, 'police': 1, 'officer': 1, 'him': 5, 'take': 2, 'pretends': 1, 'have': 1, 'something': 1, 'shoe': 1, 'passerby': 2, 'After': 1, 'runs': 1, 'away': 1, 'tries': 1, 'find': 2, 'give': 1, 'back': 1, 'It': 1, 'same': 1, 'before': 1, 'recognizes': 1, 'hits': 1, 'an': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'bain': 1, 'once': 1, 'more': 1, 'note': 1, 'says': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'finally': 1, 'seems': 1, 'love': 1, 'keeps': 1, '/': 1}	{'PROPN': 10, 'AUX': 9, 'VERB': 34, 'CCONJ': 8, 'PRON': 28, 'NOUN': 39, 'ADP': 17, 'PUNCT': 22, 'ADV': 15, 'DET': 31, 'SCONJ': 6, 'ADJ': 2, 'PART': 8, 'SYM': 1}

Our protagonist is pretty concentrated in smoking his cigarette when he sees a baby who is crying on the floor. Charles Chaplin decides to place him in a nearby baby carriage of a woman who passes by, but she doesn’t want to take care of the baby so the woman is pretty mad after realizing it. Without any remaining clue about the parents of the newborn, Charles Chaplin returns the baby to his original spot. However, a policeman appears and he has to take the newborn again. The child keeps on crying, so our protagonist leaves him in the arms of an old man and runs back to hide in the first location, hoping to get rid of the baby. Unfortunately, the old man leaves the newborn in the same baby carriage in which Charles Chaplin had tried to leave him, so when the woman sees him again, attacks our protagonist with her umbrella, calling the attention of the policeman and forcing Charles Chaplin to take the baby again. Desperate, he sits down on the curb of the sidewalk, looking at a sewer to see if the newborn would fit in it, although he abandons that idea soon after. Suddenly, Charles Chaplin finds a note inside the clothes of the baby which says “Please love and care for this orphan child” and, moved by these sincere words, he finally decides to keep the newborn with him.		{'The': 2, 'video': 1, 'starts': 1, 'with': 4, 'the': 26, 'apparition': 1, 'of': 9, 'protagonist': 4, ',': 17, 'Charles': 6, 'Chaplin': 6, 'whose': 1, 'suit': 1, 'is': 4, 'stained': 1, 'different': 1, 'construction': 1, 'materials': 1, 'dropped': 1, 'by': 3, 'men': 1, 'at': 2, 'windows': 1, '.': 9, 'Our': 1, 'pretty': 2, 'concentrated': 1, 'in': 7, 'smoking': 1, 'his': 2, 'cigarette': 1, 'when': 2, 'he': 5, 'sees': 2, 'a': 6, 'baby': 8, 'who': 2, 'crying': 2, 'on': 3, 'floor': 1, 'decides': 2, 'to': 10, 'place': 1, 'him': 5, 'nearby': 1, 'carriage': 2, 'woman': 3, 'passes': 1, 'but': 1, 'she': 1, 'does': 1, 'n’t': 1, 'want': 1, 'take': 3, 'care': 2, 'so': 3, 'mad': 1, 'after': 2, 'realizing': 1, 'it': 2, 'Without': 1, 'any': 1, 'remaining': 1, 'clue': 1, 'about': 1, 'parents': 1, 'newborn': 5, 'returns': 1, 'original': 1, 'spot': 1, 'However': 1, 'policeman': 2, 'appears': 1, 'and': 5, 'has': 1, 'again': 3, 'child': 2, 'keeps': 1, 'our': 2, 'leaves': 2, 'arms': 1, 'an': 1, 'old': 2, 'man': 2, 'runs': 1, 'back': 1, 'hide': 1, 'first': 1, 'location': 1, 'hoping': 1, 'get': 1, 'rid': 1, 'Unfortunately': 1, 'same': 1, 'which': 2, 'had': 1, 'tried': 1, 'leave': 1, 'attacks': 1, 'her': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'calling': 1, 'attention': 1, 'forcing': 1, 'Desperate': 1, 'sits': 1, 'down': 1, 'curb': 1, 'sidewalk': 1, 'looking': 1, 'sewer': 1, 'see': 1, 'if': 1, 'would': 1, 'fit': 1, 'although': 1, 'abandons': 1, 'that': 1, 'idea': 1, 'soon': 1, 'Suddenly': 1, 'finds': 1, 'note': 1, 'inside': 1, 'clothes': 1, 'says': 1, '“': 1, 'Please': 1, 'love': 1, 'for': 1, 'this': 1, 'orphan': 1, '”': 1, 'moved': 1, 'these': 1, 'sincere': 1, 'words': 1, 'finally': 1, 'keep': 1}	{'DET': 40, 'NOUN': 53, 'VERB': 44, 'ADP': 35, 'PUNCT': 28, 'PROPN': 12, 'AUX': 8, 'ADJ': 11, 'PRON': 23, 'ADV': 13, 'SCONJ': 5, 'PART': 10, 'CCONJ': 7, 'INTJ': 1}

Then he sees a woman with a stroller, walking around another baby so Chaplin mistakenly thinks that the baby he's just found is hers too. He leaves the baby in the stroller, but the woman fights back at him as that baby is not hers. Chaplin takes again the baby in his arms and procedes to leave him again where he found him in the ground, but the policeman approaches him from his back and tells Chaplin off for abandoning the baby. <br/> Chaplin takes the baby once more the baby and in the moment he encounters with another man, he puts the baby in the man's arms and, when the man gets distracted, runs away. <br/> The strange man looks strangely at the baby, and as Chaplin did shortly before, leaves the baby again in the woman's stroller, which is stopped in front of a shop. <br/> The man escapes, but right in that moment Chaplin walks past the shop and the woman goes running after him and hits him repitedly with her umbrella, until Chaplin takes again the baby from the stroller. <br/> Chaplin sits on the sidewalk with the baby on his lap, and discovers a letter folded in the baby's blanket: It turns out that the baby is and orphan and needs someone who can protect and care for him, which Chaplin does in the end of the video.

The baby is lying on the floor, so Chaplin takes the boy and he looks around to find if his mother or any member of the family of that baby is near it. In that moment a woman goes through and Chaplin thought she was the mother of that baby. Chaplin proudly gives the baby to the woman and he leaves. However it's not her son and the woman runs after Chaplin and hits him with an umbrella. Therefore Chaplin takes again the baby and put him back where he found it. Unfortunately a policeman saw what he was doing and Chaplin, afraid that the cop took him to the jail, takes again the baby with him. He tries to give the baby to a lame man but again did not work. At the end, Chaplin sits down on the street and he saw a little piece of sheet inside the baby's clothes. It says that he was an orphan so someone please take care of him so Chaplin feels sorry for the baby and adopts him.

However, a second person hit him with the rubbish and annoyed, he begins to prepare another cigarette since the first one is now off. When he finishes, he finds a baby next to a bin and decides to take him. By chance, he finds a woman with another baby and goes to give her the baby he has just found, but the woman tells him to go away with him because the baby doesn't belong to her. After that confussion, the man tries to return the baby back to where it was, next to the bin, but a policeman discoveres him and he takes the baby and goes in another direction. Suddenly he finds another man and lies to him to take the baby because he is supposedly preparing his shoes, but runs away. This new man runs following the other and leave the baby just next to another baby, which is the same one from the woman at the beginning. When the woman comes out of the shop, the first man is passing by and she thinks that he tried to give her back the found baby again so she hits him. After an argument in which the woman tries to force him to take the baby and go away, the policeman comes back and the man has no other option, he takes the baby and leaves.

He takes out his gloves, throw them to the bin, continues smoking and finds an abandoned baby that puts into the baby cart of a woman thinking she dropped it, but the woman gets angry and he has to take the baby, leaving him where he initially was until a security guard discovers him, so he takes the baby with him and ask a man to hold him while fastening his shoes(which was an excuse) and runs away. The other man does the same strategy he tried to do with the woman and she sees Chaplin, hits him and makes him take the baby.

Then, he sees a man and asks him to take the baby so he can tie his shoelaces (he does not even have laces on his shoes), but he rans away.  <br/> In the following scene, the man that has the baby puts it in the carriage of the woman that appeared before while she was not looking and leaves, and in the very moment she sees that there are two babies in the carriage, Chapling is near and she thinks that it has been him who has put the baby in the carriage so she beats him and complains to the police officer.  <br/> At the end, Chaplin has the baby once more in his arms and sees a note that says that the baby is an orphan and needs someone to take care of him.		{'At': 3, 'the': 21, 'beginning': 1, ',': 11, 'we': 1, 'see': 2, 'Chapling': 2, 'walking': 1, 'down': 1, 'street': 1, 'and': 11, 'stopping': 1, 'to': 7, 'take': 3, 'a': 9, 'cigarrete': 1, '.': 7, 'that': 8, 'moment': 2, 'he': 10, 'realizes': 1, 'there': 3, 'is': 3, 'baby': 9, 'on': 2, 'floor': 1, 'by': 1, 'trash': 1, 'can': 2, 'takes': 1, 'it': 7, '<': 4, 'br/': 4, '>': 4, 'Then': 2, 'sees': 4, 'woman': 3, 'with': 1, 'carriage': 5, 'thinks': 2, 'probably': 1, 'fell': 1, 'off': 1, 'she': 5, 'did': 1, 'not': 3, 'so': 4, 'tries': 1, 'put': 2, 'back': 2, 'in': 6, 'but': 2, 'yells': 1, 'at': 2, 'him': 6, 'When': 1, 'Charles': 1, 'goes': 1, 'leave': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'was': 2, 'police': 2, 'officer': 2, 'looking': 2, 'pretends': 1, 'be': 1, 'just': 1, 'taking': 1, 'walk': 1, 'man': 2, 'asks': 1, 'tie': 1, 'his': 3, 'shoelaces': 1, '(': 1, 'does': 1, 'even': 1, 'have': 1, 'laces': 1, 'shoes': 1, ')': 1, 'rans': 1, 'away': 1, ' ': 2, 'In': 1, 'following': 1, 'scene': 1, 'has': 4, 'puts': 1, 'of': 2, 'appeared': 1, 'before': 1, 'while': 1, 'leaves': 1, 'very': 1, 'are': 1, 'two': 1, 'babies': 1, 'near': 1, 'been': 1, 'who': 1, 'beats': 1, 'complains': 1, 'end': 1, 'Chaplin': 1, 'once': 1, 'more': 1, 'arms': 1, 'note': 1, 'says': 1, 'an': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'needs': 1, 'someone': 1, 'care': 1}	{'ADP': 21, 'DET': 32, 'NOUN': 43, 'PUNCT': 20, 'PRON': 40, 'VERB': 42, 'PROPN': 6, 'CCONJ': 13, 'PART': 9, 'X': 10, 'ADV': 13, 'SCONJ': 9, 'AUX': 11, 'SPACE': 2, 'ADJ': 2, 'NUM': 1}

Once he has insulted the last of these people, Chaplin lights a cigarrette. He throws his old gloves to the rubbish and, suddenly, he discovers a crying baby on the floor. He takes the baby and, while he was thinking that it had fallen from the buildings, he sees a woman with a baby car (with another baby in it). Chaplin gives her the baby, but she agressively refuses him. He is about to abandon the baby where he first found him, but a policeman catches him. Chaplin takes the baby again and this time he gives him to an old man with a long beard. Chaplin runs and hides on a corner. Curiously enough, the old man puts the baby on the woman's baby car, and when Chaplin is walking next to it, the woman discovers the baby. She gets angry and violently hits Chaplin with her umbrella, forcing him to take the baby away. The policeman arrives and Chaplin has to run away with the baby. He then sits down on the street and finds a note within the baby's clothes: ""Please love and care for this orphan child"".

There are several characters: Chaplin, a baby, a mother, an old man with beard and a policeman. <br/>  <br/> Chaplin is walking on the street, he passed next to a building from where someone throws away (bricks or something like that). Afterwards, close to the container somebody drops again some waste through the window and almost hit Chaplin. Then, Chaplin lights a cigar (that takes from a tin where he keeps them). There Chaplin realizes that there is a baby next to the container. He seems to think that someone threw it through the window too (like the rubbish). Then a policeman apperars and is observing him; he seems to be afraid of the police. Suddenly, a mother with a baby pass by Chaplin and he tries to leave her the baby but she refuses, she hasn’t lost a baby. So Chaplin takes again the baby, continues walking and when he sees an old man, asks him to hold the baby because Chaplin needs to tie his shoelaces, then quickly Chaplin runs away. Afterwards, the old man  finds a babycar without an adult taking care of it and decides to leave the baby in it. Then, when the mother sees again the baby inside her babycar and Chaplin hanging around she gets the baby back to Chaplin; He accepts to take care of the baby in order to avoid problems with the policeman who watches him. Finally, Chaplin is sitting on the street with the baby on his arms, searches among the baby’s clothes and finds a note that says something like “take care and love this orphand child”. The story finishes with Chaplin leaving the scene happy with her new baby.		{'This': 1, 'story': 2, 'is': 5, 'located': 1, 'in': 3, 'a': 14, 'city': 1, '.': 14, 'There': 2, 'are': 1, 'several': 1, 'characters': 1, ':': 1, 'Chaplin': 13, ',': 15, 'baby': 14, 'mother': 3, 'an': 3, 'old': 3, 'man': 3, 'with': 6, 'beard': 1, 'and': 9, 'policeman': 3, '<': 2, 'br/': 2, '>': 2, ' ': 2, 'walking': 2, 'on': 3, 'the': 21, 'street': 2, 'he': 5, 'passed': 1, 'next': 2, 'to': 12, 'building': 1, 'from': 2, 'where': 2, 'someone': 2, 'throws': 1, 'away': 2, '(': 3, 'bricks': 1, 'or': 1, 'something': 2, 'like': 3, 'that': 5, ')': 3, 'Afterwards': 2, 'close': 1, 'container': 2, 'somebody': 1, 'drops': 1, 'again': 3, 'some': 1, 'waste': 1, 'through': 2, 'window': 2, 'almost': 1, 'hit': 1, 'Then': 3, 'lights': 1, 'cigar': 1, 'takes': 2, 'tin': 1, 'keeps': 1, 'them': 1, 'realizes': 1, 'there': 1, 'He': 2, 'seems': 2, 'think': 1, 'threw': 1, 'it': 3, 'too': 1, 'rubbish': 1, 'apperars': 1, 'observing': 1, 'him': 3, ';': 2, 'be': 1, 'afraid': 1, 'of': 3, 'police': 1, 'Suddenly': 1, 'pass': 1, 'by': 1, 'tries': 1, 'leave': 2, 'her': 3, 'but': 1, 'she': 3, 'refuses': 1, 'has': 1, 'n’t': 1, 'lost': 1, 'So': 1, 'continues': 1, 'when': 2, 'sees': 2, 'asks': 1, 'hold': 1, 'because': 1, 'needs': 1, 'tie': 1, 'his': 2, 'shoelaces': 1, 'then': 1, 'quickly': 1, 'runs': 1, 'finds': 2, 'babycar': 2, 'without': 1, 'adult': 1, 'taking': 1, 'care': 3, 'decides': 1, 'inside': 1, 'hanging': 1, 'around': 1, 'gets': 1, 'back': 1, 'accepts': 1, 'take': 2, 'order': 1, 'avoid': 1, 'problems': 1, 'who': 1, 'watches': 1, 'Finally': 1, 'sitting': 1, 'arms': 1, 'searches': 1, 'among': 1, '’s': 1, 'clothes': 1, 'note': 1, 'says': 1, '“': 1, 'love': 1, 'this': 1, 'orphand': 1, 'child': 1, '”': 1, 'The': 1, 'finishes': 1, 'leaving': 1, 'scene': 1, 'happy': 1, 'new': 1}	{'DET': 42, 'NOUN': 56, 'AUX': 6, 'VERB': 48, 'ADP': 31, 'PUNCT': 40, 'PRON': 33, 'ADJ': 8, 'PROPN': 17, 'CCONJ': 11, 'X': 4, 'SPACE': 2, 'ADV': 22, 'SCONJ': 7, 'PART': 10}

Then, someone takes their trash out through the window aiming to a trash can that is on the street, but accidently  all the trash falls over Chaplin.  <br/> He then decides to lit a cigar, and in order to do so he first takes out his packet; chooses a cigar; puts his cane on his arm as to hold it properly while he lits the cigar; then, he takes off his gloves; takes a match from his pocket, and by scratching a match on his shoe Chaplin lits his cigar; takes the cane right back in his hands, and throws away his gloves.  <br/> Suddenly, Chaplin is interrupted by the cry of a baby that is near the trash cans, he looks at it closely and looks up as to see if someone had thrown him out through the window as with the trash. Chaplin decides to pick up the baby, and, as he does this, he sees a woman walking by pushing a stroller with a baby in it. Assuming that the woman is related to the baby he has just picked up, he calls upon her and decides to put the baby inside the stroller. Once the woman realizes what Chaplin had done she calls him off and Chaplin quickly decides to take back the baby. Both the lady and Chaplin walk away. <br/> Chaplin decides to put back the baby where he found it, near the trash cans. As he is doing this, a policeman stands right behind him, observing him. Right when Chaplin is about to walk  away from the baby he notices that the policeman has just seen him ""abandoning"" the baby, and rapidly understands that the policeman might misunderstand the situation and rushes back to pick him up.  <br/> In the next scene, we observe Chaplin walking away with the baby as he meets a man in the street. Chaplin decides to trick him by asking the man if he could hold the baby as he ties his shoes. When he starts tying his shoes and the man is distracted with the baby, Chaplin runs away. And when the man realizes what Chaplin is doing he starts chasing him. But, as he loses track of Chaplin, he decides to put the baby in the stroller Chaplin had previously put the baby and runs away. <br/> In the following scene, Chaplin gets out of his hiding place and as he goes out he encounters the policeman and he runs away. Then, the woman with the stroller sees Chaplin and figures that he was the one that had put bakc the baby in the stroller and decides to hit Chaplin with her umbrella until he feels obliged to pick the baby up once again.  <br/> In the last scene Chaplin is seen sitting with the baby and trying to decide what to do with him. He opens a sewer and considers putting the baby inside it, but he finally decides not to do it.

Then he takes out of his pocket a metal box where there are several cigars. He takes one and puts it between his lips. Then he takes off his gloves and throws them into a trash bin after lighting the cigar. <br/> After that he looks to the left and finds a baby on the floor. He tries to find the baby’s parents, for that reason he gets close to a woman who is walking through the street with a baby carriage and puts the baby into the baby carriage. However, the woman tells him that this is not his/her baby and she goes away angrily. <br/> Chaplin decides to put the baby in the same place where he found him/her, but a policeman discovers him. So, he has to catch the baby again. This time he lies to an old man to hold the baby and Chaplin runs away and hides from him. The old man tries to find Chaplin. As he does not do it, he leaves the baby in the baby carriage which we have seen before.  <br/> Chaplin comes out of hiding and finds the policeman again, so he takes another way. He walks next to the baby carriage and the woman follows him with an umbrella to hit him. They are arguing about the baby when the policeman appears. For that reason, Chaplin decides to takes the baby again. <br/> He does not know what to do with the baby and he thinks about it while sitting on the street. Then he finds a note where we can read that someone wants the baby to be loved and care for. Finally Chaplin decides to keep the baby.		{'Chaplin': 7, 'is': 3, 'walking': 2, 'through': 2, 'a': 9, 'street': 3, ',': 8, 'when': 2, 'suddenly': 1, 'some': 1, 'rubbish': 1, 'falls': 1, 'on': 3, 'him': 7, '.': 20, 'He': 5, 'looks': 2, 'bit': 1, 'angry': 1, 'Then': 3, 'he': 12, 'takes': 5, 'out': 2, 'of': 2, 'his': 4, 'pocket': 1, 'metal': 1, 'box': 1, 'where': 3, 'there': 1, 'are': 2, 'several': 1, 'cigars': 1, 'one': 1, 'and': 11, 'puts': 2, 'it': 3, 'between': 1, 'lips': 1, 'off': 1, 'gloves': 1, 'throws': 1, 'them': 1, 'into': 2, 'trash': 1, 'bin': 1, 'after': 1, 'lighting': 1, 'the': 24, 'cigar': 1, '<': 4, 'br/': 4, '>': 4, 'After': 1, 'that': 5, 'to': 14, 'left': 1, 'finds': 3, 'baby': 17, 'floor': 1, 'tries': 2, 'find': 2, '’s': 1, 'parents': 1, 'for': 2, 'reason': 2, 'gets': 1, 'close': 1, 'woman': 3, 'who': 1, 'with': 3, 'carriage': 4, 'However': 1, 'tells': 1, 'this': 1, 'not': 3, '/': 2, 'her': 2, 'she': 1, 'goes': 1, 'away': 2, 'angrily': 1, 'decides': 3, 'put': 1, 'in': 2, 'same': 1, 'place': 1, 'found': 1, 'but': 1, 'policeman': 3, 'discovers': 1, 'So': 1, 'has': 1, 'catch': 1, 'again': 3, 'This': 1, 'time': 1, 'lies': 1, 'an': 2, 'old': 2, 'man': 2, 'hold': 1, 'runs': 1, 'hides': 1, 'from': 1, 'The': 1, 'As': 1, 'does': 2, 'do': 2, 'leaves': 1, 'which': 1, 'we': 2, 'have': 1, 'seen': 1, 'before': 1, ' ': 1, 'comes': 1, 'hiding': 1, 'so': 1, 'another': 1, 'way': 1, 'walks': 1, 'next': 1, 'follows': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'hit': 1, 'They': 1, 'arguing': 1, 'about': 2, 'appears': 1, 'For': 1, 'know': 1, 'what': 1, 'thinks': 1, 'while': 1, 'sitting': 1, 'note': 1, 'can': 1, 'read': 1, 'someone': 1, 'wants': 1, 'be': 1, 'loved': 1, 'care': 1, 'Finally': 1, 'keep': 1}	{'PROPN': 8, 'AUX': 9, 'VERB': 55, 'ADP': 30, 'DET': 41, 'NOUN': 56, 'PUNCT': 28, 'SCONJ': 9, 'ADV': 16, 'PRON': 45, 'ADJ': 6, 'NUM': 1, 'CCONJ': 12, 'X': 9, 'PART': 14, 'SYM': 2, 'SPACE': 1}

This fragment has been taken from the movie 'The Kid', and I am going to sum up what I saw. <br/> Charles Chaplin was going through a street when suddenly he found a baby behind some trash bins. Not knowing what he should do, he starts to go around, with the baby on his arms, trying to find him a place to stay. But he realises that another baby's trolley, an old man's arms, or the same place where he found him, are not the best options, as there is a policeman around, and he does not want himself to be accused for something wrongly. At the end, desperated, he sits on the street and discovers that the baby has a note within his clothes which begs love and care as he is orphan. So Chaplin, apparently, takes care about this poor baby and takes him home.

It is black and white and the only sound to hear is the music that follows the actions of the characters. The few times we can ""hear"", actually reading"" what they may say, is in slides that occationally appear. The protagonist, who walks in a silly way along a street, feels anoyed when someone throws things, through the window in the building next to him, and as a consecuence, hitting him. After that, he stops to relax and looks for a cigarrette to smoke. He burns it and start to smoke. Then, he finds an orphan baby and looks for his parents. At the same time, a woman carrying her own baby passes by and the protagonist, who thought that he might be the baby's mother, puts him next to the other baby in the babycar but the woman refuses to keep it since it was not hers. Next, the protagonist thinks of leaving the baby where he found it but a policeofficer enters and the obviously couldn't leave the baby. Looking for another option, he sees another man walking and asks hi to hold the baby while he ""mends a problem he had with his shoes"" but runs away leaving the baby with that man. Now it is his problem. However, that man did not know what to do either and found the same babycar with the previous baby in front of a shop and leaves it there. Then, the mother goes out and finds the baby next to hers and tries to find the person who left him there, when the protagonist appears again and the woman, very agressively, gives the child to him again. He doesn't know what to do and sits on the street. He tthinks on leaving the baby underground but he refuses the idea.

First he leaves it on a baby trolly with another child but the woman that is strolling it argues with him and tells Charles to grab it and go away. Then, he tries to leave the baby right on the spot he found it. However, a policeman stops him and intimidates Charles in order to pick up the baby. Sooner rather than later Chaplin turns left and locates an old homeless man and gives him the little child just to trick him. Running away, Chaplin hides himself from the old man. Nevertheless, this homeless man finds once again the same baby trolley of that women from before and leaves the child on it. In an unlucky turn of the events, Chaplin walks in front of that trolley only to find out that the baby is there and has to pick him up because of the rampaging behaviour of that mather and also of the previous police officer from before who threatens him. Later, in an exhauster condition, decides to seat in the sidewalk, just to come across with a note between the messy dirty bed sheet in which the baby was covered. ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". This was the emotional message written down on that crumpled paper, which made him take the decission of keeping the baby."

He keeps on walking while he is smoking a cigarette, and he is attacked again, but this time by a different person who throws his or her trash out of the window. Chaplin seems a bit angry; however, he checks a box he is carrying with him in order to smoke another cigarette again. Once he starts smoking, he takes off his gloves and decides to throw them in the bin next to him. Just when he throw them away he hears some noise, like a baby crying, so what he does is to turn around and sees that there is a baby alone in the street wrapped up in blankets. He begins to analyse the situation and looking everywhere because leaving a baby in the street is a very cruel act. While he is taking the baby with him, there is a woman with a baby carriage walking behind him. Chaplin sees her so he walks towards her with the intention of leaving her the baby. He leaves the baby in the carriage and the woman beings to argue with him because the baby is not hers; therefore, Charles has to take the baby with him again and wants to leave him in the place where he found him. However, at that moment a pollice officer appears behing him and sees what Charles Chaplin is doing. He is caught in the action and the policeman believes he is abandoning his baby. When Chaplin sees the officer behind him, he quickly takes the baby with him again and starts walking down the street. He runs into a man and gives him the baby with the excuse that he needs to tie his shoes, so he is pretending he is doing that when all of a sudden he runs away. The man notices what Chaplin has done and goes everywhere looking for him but he cannot find him because he is hidden. That man fins a baby carriage in the street so he decides to leave the baby in it and runs away. Chaplin leaves his hiding place and walks next to the baby carriage exactly when the woman appears and sees the new baby in her carriage. As she sees the baby, she sees Chaplin too, so she thinks that the one that let the baby there was him and not the other man; therefore she follows him and starts hitting him with her umbrella. The policeman observes the situation and the woman argues with him and with Chaplin, so he is forced to take the baby with again. He sits down in the pavement next to a sewer and watches it with the intention of leaving the baby there, but finally he does ot do that. He checks the baby and fins a letter in the blankets that says ""please love and care for this orphan child"". Then, the video finishes with him looking at the baby and smiling at him."

He does it, but he starts to run away when the boy is helding the baby. This boy realises that Chaplin has lied him and he decides the same that Chaplin had decided it before: put the baby in the ""baby car"" of the other woman. When the woman sees the baby again, she looks for Chaplin and starts to hit him with the umbrella. In that moment, the policeman appears again and Chaplin and the woman stop. The video ends with Chaplin reading a piece of paper that is found on the baby clothes. In that note Chaplin reads that he has to take care the baby like it was his baby. So he decides to do it."

Then, the gentleman goes again to the corner he found the baby and he gently places the little creature on the pavement. Soon, he regrets his choice by seeing a policeman just behind his back. He takes the baby and walks away, he approaches to an old bearder man and tries to give him the child by distracting him. The curious hat-man runs and runs. He hides from the bearded man. Again, the same stroller appears and the old man is tempted to leave the baby there. From a near shop, the woman comes out and thinks that the hat-man gentleman has for a second time left the baby in her stroller. Angrily, she bets the gentleman again and again with the help of an umbrella. Few seconds after and the policeman appears and the gentleman is forced to take the baby with him. He carries the baby through an alley and sits down. He hesitates what to do with the little one, but then he finds a paper note that triggers his feelings. ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". He smiles and takes the baby in his hands."

At the beginning, Charles Chaplin discovered the lonely child crying his eyes out in the street. Although he decided to take the baby, he changed his tune and firstly tried to leave the baby in a stroller together with another baby. Obviously, the mother noticed and left the scene immediately after without the baby. Later, Chaplin tried to abandon the baby at the very same place where he was found. A policeman saw him and he was forced to take the baby again. Two more attemps were done in order to get rid of the baby. Finally, Chaplin, who was totally desperate, is sitting down the street and he discovered a paper inside the blanket covered the baby body. The baby was orphan and somebody should take care of him. Eventually, Chaplin is out of scene carried the baby smiling.		{'The': 2, 'main': 1, 'argument': 1, 'of': 4, 'the': 17, 'video': 1, 'is': 3, 'Charles': 2, 'Chaplin': 5, 'trying': 1, 'to': 6, 'lumber': 1, 'people': 1, 'with': 2, 'a': 3, 'baby': 11, '.': 10, 'At': 1, 'beginning': 1, ',': 8, 'discovered': 2, 'lonely': 1, 'child': 1, 'crying': 1, 'his': 2, 'eyes': 1, 'out': 2, 'in': 3, 'street': 2, 'Although': 1, 'he': 5, 'decided': 1, 'take': 3, 'changed': 1, 'tune': 1, 'and': 5, 'firstly': 1, 'tried': 2, 'leave': 1, 'stroller': 1, 'together': 1, 'another': 1, 'Obviously': 1, 'mother': 1, 'noticed': 1, 'left': 1, 'scene': 2, 'immediately': 1, 'after': 1, 'without': 1, 'Later': 1, 'abandon': 1, 'at': 1, 'very': 1, 'same': 1, 'place': 1, 'where': 1, 'was': 4, 'found': 1, 'A': 1, 'policeman': 1, 'saw': 1, 'him': 2, 'forced': 1, 'again': 1, 'Two': 1, 'more': 1, 'attemps': 1, 'were': 1, 'done': 1, 'order': 1, 'get': 1, 'rid': 1, 'Finally': 1, 'who': 1, 'totally': 1, 'desperate': 1, 'sitting': 1, 'down': 1, 'paper': 1, 'inside': 1, 'blanket': 1, 'covered': 1, 'body': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'somebody': 1, 'should': 1, 'care': 1, 'Eventually': 1, 'carried': 1, 'smiling': 1}	{'DET': 24, 'ADJ': 5, 'NOUN': 33, 'ADP': 17, 'AUX': 10, 'PROPN': 7, 'VERB': 25, 'PART': 6, 'PUNCT': 18, 'PRON': 11, 'SCONJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 5, 'ADV': 10, 'NUM': 1}

After picking a new one from his case, takes out his worn-out gloves and lights it. After walking for a while finds a baby lying on the floor, crying. He picks it and, after seeing a woman walking by with a baby stroller, he thinks that child may be hers, so Chaplin puts it on her stroller. Charles argues with her, as it wasn't her baby, and when Chaplin tries to leave the baby where it was, a police officer sees him, with an inquisitive look so Chaplin walks away with the baby to find an old man, and tricks him to pick the baby while he ties his shoes, so he can run away. The old man, after finding the same atroller as Chaplin, leaves the kid there and walks away. The woman who was pushing the stroller finds the baby there, surprised, and when Chaplin is walking nearby, she hits him with her umbrella and forces him to take the child, with a little help from the silent police officer. After a short walk, Chaplin sits on the sidewalk near a sewer, and thinks about trowing the baby away, but eventually finds a note saying it's an orphan child, so he pities the baby and takes it with him.

He decided to stop and smoke a cigarette but then, he found a baby on the floor. The very first thing he thought was about to carry him and go to find his family but the search wasn't so easy.  <br/> Firstly, the man saw a woman who carried a baby in a trolley so, what he did was to deliver the baby to that woman, but she, in an angry mood, hit the man and returned the baby to him. Apparently, he wasn't her son.  <br/> Right after that, Chaplin tried to let the baby just in the same place he found it but a policeman was around so Chaplin decided to carry the baby again because he didn't want to be accused for abandoning a baby.  <br/> Another man who was passing through, agreed to help Charles and got the baby for a moment, moment that Charles took advantage of and run away. <br/> Finally, that man let the baby in the trolley of the former woman, the one who hit Charles, while she was in some kind of shop but when she got out and find the baby, she returned him to Charles.  <br/> When Charles Chaplin saw that he couldn't get ride of the baby, he found a note saying that the baby was an orphan child and the person who left him wished all the love and care for him.

Then, he opens a box of cigarettes and he starts to smoke another one. As he looks down, he sees a baby next to a bin. He holds the baby in his arms and looks around, trying to find his relatives. Since he didn't find anyone, he left the kid in another baby's buggy. However, a woman (probably the other baby's mother) came out of a house very annoyed and gave the child back to Charles Chaplin.

He gave the baby to an old man who can't walk very well, and then runs away. The old man left the baby in the same baby buggy. The woman came out again, very angry, and exactly at that point Charles Chaplin was walking next to the buggy, so she kicks him and returns the kid to Chaplin.

Disrupted, stops to smoke a cigar when he spots an abandoned baby crying. Surprised by the incident, he tries looking for the parent of the child when woman passes by with a stroller trying to hand off the child, but failing since it is not hers. Chaplin attempts to leave the baby where he first found it, but yet again fails due to the police observing him. Leaving, he makes his final attempt to get away from the baby, he ask a favor to a bearded man to hold the child to clean his shoes, however he makes a run from it. The bearded man leaves the child in a stroller, coming to find out it is the same from earlier. Chaplin walking by is attacked by the same women, forcing Chaplin to take the child. When sitting down, he finds a note written by the parent saying “please love and care for this orphan child.” Reading that letter, he feels sorry for the baby ultimately, decides to keep and raise it.		{'In': 2, 'the': 15, 'opening': 1, 'scene': 1, 'we': 1, 'see': 1, 'Chaplin': 4, ',': 15, 'an': 3, 'impoverished': 1, 'man': 3, 'walking': 2, 'a': 9, 'lower': 1, '-': 1, 'class': 1, 'area': 1, 'interrupted': 1, 'by': 7, 'what': 1, 'it': 6, 'seems': 1, 'to': 12, 'be': 1, 'rubbish': 1, 'falling': 1, 'on': 1, 'top': 1, 'of': 2, 'his': 3, 'head': 1, 'thrown': 1, 'person': 1, 'calling': 1, 'him': 2, '“': 2, 'awkward': 1, 'ass': 1, '”': 2, '.': 9, 'Disrupted': 1, 'stops': 1, 'smoke': 1, 'cigar': 1, 'when': 2, 'he': 8, 'spots': 1, 'abandoned': 1, 'baby': 4, 'crying': 1, 'Surprised': 1, 'incident': 1, 'tries': 1, 'looking': 1, 'for': 3, 'parent': 2, 'child': 6, 'woman': 1, 'passes': 1, 'with': 1, 'stroller': 2, 'trying': 1, 'hand': 1, 'off': 1, 'but': 2, 'failing': 1, 'since': 1, 'is': 3, 'not': 1, 'hers': 1, 'attempts': 1, 'leave': 1, 'where': 1, 'first': 1, 'found': 1, 'yet': 1, 'again': 1, 'fails': 1, 'due': 1, 'police': 1, 'observing': 1, 'Leaving': 1, 'makes': 2, 'final': 1, 'attempt': 1, 'get': 1, 'away': 1, 'from': 3, 'ask': 1, 'favor': 1, 'bearded': 2, 'hold': 1, 'clean': 1, 'shoes': 1, 'however': 1, 'run': 1, 'The': 1, 'leaves': 1, 'in': 1, 'coming': 1, 'find': 1, 'out': 1, 'same': 2, 'earlier': 1, 'attacked': 1, 'women': 1, 'forcing': 1, 'take': 1, 'When': 1, 'sitting': 1, 'down': 1, 'finds': 1, 'note': 1, 'written': 1, 'saying': 1, 'please': 1, 'love': 1, 'and': 2, 'care': 1, 'this': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'Reading': 1, 'that': 1, 'letter': 1, 'feels': 1, 'sorry': 1, 'ultimately': 1, 'decides': 1, 'keep': 1, 'raise': 1}	{'ADP': 25, 'DET': 30, 'NOUN': 39, 'PRON': 21, 'VERB': 49, 'PROPN': 4, 'PUNCT': 29, 'ADJ': 11, 'PART': 11, 'AUX': 4, 'SCONJ': 5, 'CCONJ': 4, 'ADV': 7, 'INTJ': 1}

Chaplin	written_online	20.0	Inside classroom		A man (Charles Chaplin) was walking in the street and decided to pick a cigarette when he found a baby that was alone so, he decided to carry him or her. Later on, he saw a woman carrying another baby and while the woman entered a shop, he put the child he found in the trolley next to the woman's baby. When the woman left the shop and found the child, she became surprised and returned the strange baby to the man. As he didn't know what to do with the baby, he decided to leave the child where he saw him/her for the first time. Nevertheless, a police officer appeared and probably thought that the poor man was trying to get rid of his own baby so, he had to keep the child with him. Chaplin was thinking about a possible manner of leaving the baby without causing him/her any harm when he saw a man wandering. Even though the man seemed to be homeless, Chaplin gave him the baby because he was unwilling to have a child's responsibility. The homeless man saw the woman again so, he thought as Chaplin did and ran away. Few seconds later, while Chaplin was walking nearby, both the officer and the woman recognised him as the man who carried the baby before and gave the baby back to him. Eventually, he decided to sit a little bit as he got so confused that he didn't know where to go with the baby.

Chaplin	written_online	10.0	Inside classroom		A man dressed in a suit is walking through the street when someone throws trash at him from above, without giving it importance he lights a cigarette. Suddlenly, he sees something on the ground; he finds it is a baby wrapped in clothes. He is overwhelmed and tries to leave the baby in a baby trolley. The woman, probably the mother, returns the baby to him. A police officer is walking around at the same time, making sure that everything is alright. As a last resort, he gives the baby to an old man walking around and flees; unluckily, this man tries to put the baby in the same trolley as the beginning and the woman, once again, returns it to the protagonist. At the end, the man debates between accepting the newfound orphan baby and abandon him once again, this time permanently. This baby has its story told since the beginning, its fate is written. That person will grow without the love of a family to whom he is no burden to; that person will have a very difficult future. And no one cares. Not the maternal figure, represented in the woman, who has a baby herself. Not the policeman, who subtly wants the man to keep the orphan because it would be easier than doing it himself. Not its parents, that are absent and just leave a note asking someone to take care of their child. And, of course, not the protagonist, who finds himself between the road of empaty or selfishness.

When he gets out, he sees some wreckage falling down the first floor. He starts shouting. Then, he takes a butt from his pocket to smoke.  <br/> Suddenly, he sees a baby crying on the floor. The little boy is completely alone. Chaplin takes the baby into his arms and looks for his mother. He sees a woman carrying a baby trolley and he puts the baby there. As the woman is not his mother, she tells him what is happening. She is fairly angry. Chaplin takes the baby and the woman leaves. In that moment, a police officer appears and he sees Chaplin putting the baby on the floor, next to a rubbish bin. The police officer tells him something like “what are you doing?” Therefore, Chaplin very scared, takes the baby again and leaves the place. While he is on his way, Chaplin finds an old man. He gives the baby to the old man and runs away from there. The old man looks for Chaplin because he doesn't want to care for the baby. As this man doesn't find him, he leaves the baby in the baby trolley again. When the woman realises what has happened, she goes nuts. She finds Chaplin and she starts hitting him with an umbrella.  <br/> At this time, the police officer appears again and the woman explains to him the problem. Chaplin takes the baby and he sits on the pavement. Chaplin hugs the little boy and he discovers a little piece of paper hidden in the baby’s blanket. It’s a note which says “please love and care for this orphan child”. He realises that the little boy doesn't have parents and he tightly hugs him. Finally, both people, the baby and Chaplin, leave the scene.

He picks up the baby, and tries to give it to a woman passing by with her own baby. The woman rejects taking care of the baby so Chaplin picks it up again, and tries to return it to the previous place where he found it. However, a police officer catches him in the act so he picks up the baby one more time. Going down the street, Chaplin sees a man and tricks him to hold the baby while Chaplin ties his boots so that he could get out of there without the baby. This man, trying to find Chaplin, sees the same baby carriage where Chaplin had unsuccessfully left the baby the first time, and leaves it there. The woman, furious about this, tries to find a solution when, unfortunately for Chaplin, he passes by in front of the woman. She chases him with an umbrella to pick the baby and carries it with him. Finally, Chaplin decides to take care of the baby since anyone else is willing to do it.

When he find the baby for the first time he is overwhelmed by the situation and try to get rid of him by giving him away to an old lady who is taking another one to a walk. The lady catch him in the moment and he is forced to take the baby again. He later tries to put the baby where he first found him, but a policeman catch him too. After that he gives the baby to a beggar who, just after that, put the baby in the same carriage Charlie tries at the beggining.

He doesn't know who this baby belongs to, but he tries to give him to a woman who is passing by with another baby. This woman doesn't seem to be very happy about the idea, and ask Chaplin furiously to take the baby back. <br/> Again, with the baby, Chaplin tries to leave it in the street in the same place when he found it. Unfortunately to Chaplin, a policeman sees him and doesn't allow him to abandon the baby. <br/> After two more attempts to get rid of the baby, Chaplin finds a note asking him to take care and love the child, and that makes Chaplin to change his mind and keep the baby.

Due to her reaction, he realizes he is wrong and returns the baby to the place he was before. At that moment, a policeman is keeping an eye on him, so he must find another way to get out of the baby's problem. Straightway, he gives the baby to another wandering man and flees.  <br/> This new character seems to think the same and drops the baby in the first woman's buggy. As we believe all this coincidences are ending, the main character appears again walking near the buggy. The woman and the policeman, who is there too, recognize him so he must carry the baby again. <br/> Finally, when he feels exhausted about this issue, he discovers a letter from the abandoned baby's mother and he is moved by what it is said, therefore he stays with the kid.

He takes off his gloves and looks around to find, surprisingly, a newborn baby laying on the floor. He doesn't know what to do when he sees an old lady , so he goes and drops the baby into her carriage. However, the lady gets mad and she gives back the baby to Chaplin. Later, he tries to leave the baby at the same spot where he found it, but a police officer sees him so he tried again by gaving the newborn to a random man who was patiently strolling. Then this man returns the baby to the same lady and the baby ends in Chaplins hands again. He gives up and keeps it.

At first, we can see Charles wandering around a poor neighbourhood, when all of a sudden a pile of rubbish is thrown at him. He does not take this into account and proceeds to light up a cigar. Suddenly, he notices that a baby is lying in the ground. Since a woman is walking by with her child, Charles thinks that the baby he has just found is hers. Therefore, he places the baby in the stroller. Nevertheless, she responds angry to Charles owing to the fact that the baby does not belong to her. As a result, he has to take the baby again with him and decides to leave him back in the place where he found him. However, a policeman discovers what Charles aims to do. Despite the fact that he cannot leave the baby there, he eventually finds a man who he asks to hold the baby for a second, which gives Charles time to escape. This man chases Chaplin but he finds a stroller, where he leaves the baby. Charles comes out of the place in which he had hidden and finds the policeman, so he has to run away again. Nevertheless, Charles passes by the stroller and the same woman he had previously encountered tells him furiously that the baby is not hers. Consequently, he has to take the baby. Finally, Charles sits on the ground holding the baby when all of a sudden he finds a piece of paper in which it is asked to please take care and love the poor child. In the end, he decides to take the baby with him and love him.		{'This': 2, 'video': 1, 'is': 7, 'a': 15, 'fragment': 1, 'of': 6, 'film': 1, 'called': 1, '“': 1, 'The': 1, 'Kid': 1, '”': 1, 'starring': 1, 'Charles': 9, 'Chaplin': 2, '.': 16, 'At': 1, 'first': 1, ',': 16, 'we': 1, 'can': 2, 'see': 1, 'wandering': 1, 'around': 1, 'poor': 2, 'neighbourhood': 1, 'when': 2, 'all': 2, 'sudden': 2, 'pile': 1, 'rubbish': 1, 'thrown': 1, 'at': 1, 'him': 7, 'He': 1, 'does': 2, 'not': 4, 'take': 5, 'this': 1, 'into': 1, 'account': 1, 'and': 6, 'proceeds': 1, 'to': 13, 'light': 1, 'up': 1, 'cigar': 1, 'Suddenly': 1, 'he': 16, 'notices': 1, 'that': 5, 'baby': 12, 'lying': 1, 'in': 5, 'the': 23, 'ground': 2, 'Since': 1, 'woman': 2, 'walking': 1, 'by': 2, 'with': 3, 'her': 2, 'child': 2, 'thinks': 1, 'has': 4, 'just': 1, 'found': 2, 'hers': 2, 'Therefore': 1, 'places': 1, 'stroller': 3, 'Nevertheless': 2, 'she': 1, 'responds': 1, 'angry': 1, 'owing': 1, 'fact': 2, 'belong': 1, 'As': 1, 'result': 1, 'again': 2, 'decides': 2, 'leave': 2, 'back': 1, 'place': 2, 'where': 2, 'However': 1, 'policeman': 2, 'discovers': 1, 'what': 1, 'aims': 1, 'do': 1, 'Despite': 1, 'there': 1, 'eventually': 1, 'finds': 4, 'man': 2, 'who': 1, 'asks': 1, 'hold': 1, 'for': 1, 'second': 1, 'which': 3, 'gives': 1, 'time': 1, 'escape': 1, 'chases': 1, 'but': 1, 'leaves': 1, 'comes': 1, 'out': 1, 'had': 2, 'hidden': 1, 'so': 1, 'run': 1, 'away': 1, 'passes': 1, 'same': 1, 'previously': 1, 'encountered': 1, 'tells': 1, 'furiously': 1, 'Consequently': 1, 'Finally': 1, 'sits': 1, 'on': 1, 'holding': 1, 'piece': 1, 'paper': 1, 'it': 1, 'asked': 1, 'please': 1, 'care': 1, 'love': 2, 'In': 1, 'end': 1}	{'DET': 40, 'NOUN': 47, 'AUX': 15, 'ADP': 29, 'VERB': 53, 'PUNCT': 34, 'PROPN': 11, 'ADV': 18, 'PRON': 38, 'ADJ': 5, 'SCONJ': 12, 'PART': 14, 'CCONJ': 7}

In spite of his worn-out clothes, he looks pretty classy and elegant: he is wearing a black suit and a bowler hat, and also uses a cane. After having been beaten by some rubbish that have fallen from a window, he searches for a cigar, takes one of the fag-ends that he keeps in a cigarette case, and, after taking off his ragged gloves, he lights it with a match and throw the gloves away. Suddenly, the tramp finds a baby who is weeping desperately on the floor next to some bins.  <br/>   <br/> He picks him up and looks up to see if the baby has fallen from a window too. Then, a woman with a pram passes in front of them and the tramp runs to her to give her the baby, since he thinks she has dropped him accidentally. The woman, who already has a baby of her own, seems to be really upset with the tramp and tells him that that baby is not hers, so the tramp takes him back and put him in the same spot where he found him. However, a police officer is just behind him and the tramp picks up the baby again from the floor. After that, he asks a bearded man to hold the baby for a moment so he can lace his shoe, but that is just a trick to get rid of him and run away. Next, the bearded man follows the tramp to give the baby back to him, but does not find him and puts the baby in the woman’s pram instead. When the woman finds that the tramp’s baby is in her pram again, she hits him with her umbrella, the police officer arrives and she accuses the tramp of abandoning the baby, so he takes him back.  <br/>  <br/> The tramp does not know what to do with the baby. He sits on the sidewalk for a moment and thinks of dropping him in the gutter, but repents of it. Then, the tramp finds a note hidden in the baby’s clothes: it asks whoever who find the baby to love and take care of him. After reading the note, the tramp smiles cheerfully at the baby and walks away with him.		{'A': 1, 'tramp': 12, 'is': 7, 'walking': 1, 'towards': 1, 'the': 35, 'camera': 1, 'from': 4, 'background': 1, '.': 15, 'In': 1, 'spite': 1, 'of': 9, 'his': 3, 'worn': 1, '-': 2, 'out': 1, 'clothes': 2, ',': 24, 'he': 10, 'looks': 2, 'pretty': 1, 'classy': 1, 'and': 16, 'elegant': 1, ':': 2, 'wearing': 1, 'a': 18, 'black': 1, 'suit': 1, 'bowler': 1, 'hat': 1, 'also': 1, 'uses': 1, 'cane': 1, 'After': 3, 'having': 1, 'been': 1, 'beaten': 1, 'by': 1, 'some': 2, 'rubbish': 1, 'that': 7, 'have': 1, 'fallen': 2, 'window': 2, 'searches': 1, 'for': 3, 'cigar': 1, 'takes': 3, 'one': 1, 'fag': 1, 'ends': 1, 'keeps': 1, 'in': 7, 'cigarette': 1, 'case': 1, 'after': 1, 'taking': 1, 'off': 1, 'ragged': 1, 'gloves': 2, 'lights': 1, 'it': 3, 'with': 6, 'match': 1, 'throw': 1, 'away': 3, 'Suddenly': 1, 'finds': 3, 'baby': 15, 'who': 3, 'weeping': 1, 'desperately': 1, 'on': 2, 'floor': 2, 'next': 1, 'to': 11, 'bins': 1, ' ': 3, '<': 4, 'br/': 4, '>': 4, '  ': 1, 'He': 2, 'picks': 2, 'him': 15, 'up': 3, 'see': 1, 'if': 1, 'has': 3, 'too': 1, 'Then': 2, 'woman': 4, 'pram': 3, 'passes': 1, 'front': 1, 'them': 1, 'runs': 1, 'her': 5, 'give': 2, 'since': 1, 'thinks': 2, 'she': 3, 'dropped': 1, 'accidentally': 1, 'The': 2, 'already': 1, 'own': 1, 'seems': 1, 'be': 1, 'really': 1, 'upset': 1, 'tells': 1, 'not': 3, 'hers': 1, 'so': 3, 'back': 3, 'put': 1, 'same': 1, 'spot': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'However': 1, 'police': 2, 'officer': 2, 'just': 2, 'behind': 1, 'again': 2, 'asks': 2, 'bearded': 2, 'man': 2, 'hold': 1, 'moment': 2, 'can': 1, 'lace': 1, 'shoe': 1, 'but': 3, 'trick': 1, 'get': 1, 'rid': 1, 'run': 1, 'Next': 1, 'follows': 1, 'does': 2, 'find': 2, 'puts': 1, '’s': 3, 'instead': 1, 'When': 1, 'hits': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'arrives': 1, 'accuses': 1, 'abandoning': 1, 'know': 1, 'what': 1, 'do': 1, 'sits': 1, 'sidewalk': 1, 'dropping': 1, 'gutter': 1, 'repents': 1, 'note': 2, 'hidden': 1, 'whoever': 1, 'love': 1, 'take': 1, 'care': 1, 'reading': 1, 'smiles': 1, 'cheerfully': 1, 'at': 1, 'walks': 1}	{'DET': 59, 'NOUN': 78, 'AUX': 16, 'VERB': 61, 'ADP': 48, 'PUNCT': 43, 'PRON': 50, 'ADV': 27, 'ADJ': 9, 'CCONJ': 19, 'NUM': 1, 'SCONJ': 8, 'SPACE': 4, 'X': 8, 'PROPN': 3, 'PART': 14}

He does not know what to do with it until he sees a woman carrying a trolley with a baby in it. He hurries up to her and puts the found baby in the trolley thinking it might be the woman's as well, but she makes him take it out angrily. He then decides to place it back on the ground, but a police officer shows up, forcing him to keep it. A lame man suddenly appears and the protagonist leaves the baby to him and rushes off without saying anything else. The lame man puts it back in the same woman's trolley. Finally the protagonist is found by her and is happy to keep the orphan baby after reading an explanatory note it was carrying in its clothes.

Bothered by the situation, he takes a cigarette from his case and looks around him trying to find the responsible of that action. While he is looking, he notices that, behind him, there is an abandoned baby lying on the floor. A confused Chaplin distinguishes a woman walking down the street with a baby stroller and, therefore, he runs towards her leaving the baby in the troller. When the lady notices about this, she gets mad since she does not recognise the baby. Chaplin and the woman argue and rapidly he comes back with the baby to the place where he found it. Then, he leaves the child again on the floor abandoning it. However, when he tries to escape, a policeman witnesses him. Chaplin takes again the baby and runs. During the chase, he leaves the baby with an old man but, subsequently, the old man leaves the baby with the aforementioned woman and then disappears. Unfortunately for Chaplin, the woman sees him again and assumes that he is the one who has left the baby in the stroller, then the woman, violently, punches him. Chaplin is forced again to take the baby and run. Apparently exhausted, he sits down in the pavement holding the child. Then he notices that within the baby’s clothes there is a note with a message that confirms that the baby is an orphan child. Finally, he opts to adopt it.		{'The': 1, 'clip': 1, 'starts': 1, 'with': 6, 'Chaplin': 6, 'walking': 2, 'around': 2, 'ruined': 1, 'buildings': 1, 'when': 2, 'suddenly': 1, 'an': 4, 'amount': 1, 'of': 2, 'trash': 1, 'fall': 1, 'on': 3, 'him': 6, '.': 15, 'Bothered': 1, 'by': 1, 'the': 29, 'situation': 1, ',': 19, 'he': 13, 'takes': 2, 'a': 6, 'cigarette': 1, 'from': 1, 'his': 1, 'case': 1, 'and': 8, 'looks': 1, 'trying': 1, 'to': 5, 'find': 1, 'responsible': 1, 'that': 6, 'action': 1, 'While': 1, 'is': 6, 'looking': 1, 'notices': 3, 'behind': 1, 'there': 2, 'abandoned': 1, 'baby': 12, 'lying': 1, 'floor': 2, 'A': 1, 'confused': 1, 'distinguishes': 1, 'woman': 5, 'down': 2, 'street': 1, 'stroller': 2, 'therefore': 1, 'runs': 2, 'towards': 1, 'her': 1, 'leaving': 1, 'in': 3, 'troller': 1, 'When': 1, 'lady': 1, 'about': 1, 'this': 1, 'she': 2, 'gets': 1, 'mad': 1, 'since': 1, 'does': 1, 'not': 1, 'recognise': 1, 'argue': 1, 'rapidly': 1, 'comes': 1, 'back': 1, 'place': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'it': 3, 'Then': 2, 'leaves': 3, 'child': 3, 'again': 4, 'abandoning': 1, 'However': 1, 'tries': 1, 'escape': 1, 'policeman': 1, 'witnesses': 1, 'During': 1, 'chase': 1, 'old': 2, 'man': 2, 'but': 1, 'subsequently': 1, 'aforementioned': 1, 'then': 2, 'disappears': 1, 'Unfortunately': 1, 'for': 1, 'sees': 1, 'assumes': 1, 'one': 1, 'who': 1, 'has': 1, 'left': 1, 'violently': 1, 'punches': 1, 'forced': 1, 'take': 1, 'run': 1, 'Apparently': 1, 'exhausted': 1, 'sits': 1, 'pavement': 1, 'holding': 1, 'within': 1, '’s': 1, 'clothes': 1, 'note': 1, 'message': 1, 'confirms': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'Finally': 1, 'opts': 1, 'adopt': 1}	{'DET': 42, 'NOUN': 48, 'VERB': 46, 'ADP': 26, 'PROPN': 6, 'ADV': 19, 'SCONJ': 10, 'PRON': 31, 'PUNCT': 34, 'CCONJ': 9, 'PART': 6, 'ADJ': 6, 'AUX': 6, 'NUM': 1}

Chaplin	written_online	17.0	Outside classroom		At the beginning, we can see Charles Chaplin walking in the street when, after an incident, he finds out a newborn baby on his way and decided to take him/her. Later, when he saw a mother with a buggy and her baby, Chaplin thought the baby he found could probably be hers and put him on that same buggy, but the woman said it was not hers and Chaplin took the baby back again. Thus, he tried to leave this kid back on the floor but he picked him up as soon as he noticed there was a police near him. Worried because of having this small kid, he convinced a man to take him/her for a while while he fled. Unfortunately for Chaplin, this man put the baby back on the mother's buggy without being caught by anyone. Hence, when the mother saw Chaplin again, she made him to take the baby out of his buggy. Finally, this hopeless Chaplin, sat down with the kid on his arms, realized that this was an abandoned baby left with a note. After reading it, Chaplin changed his mind about the baby and we can imagine that he looked after the baby as the paper he read only asked for this baby to be loved as he had been abandoned.

He stops to take a cigarette out of a case and, suddenly, he sees a baby lying on the floor. He picks up the child and realises that, behind him, there is a lady pushing around a pram. Chaplin thinks that the baby must be one of her children and tries to place him in the pram. The lady reacts furiously and obliges him to take his child away.  <br/> Not knowing what to do, Chaplin comes back to where he found the baby and attempts to leave him there again. However, a policeman appears and he is forced to take the baby with him. He decides then to give it to a bearded man who was passing by. The man, who suddenly realised that Chaplin was running away, also tries to get rid of the baby by putting him inside the pram of the woman mentioned before. By chance, she left the stroller unattended while making an errand, so the bearded man has the opportunity to leave the baby in the pram and run away.  <br/> Chaplin, who thinks that he finally could get rid of the baby, passes by the pram when the lady is finding out that she has two babies instead of one. Again she blames Chaplin and starts hitting him with her umbrella until he takes the baby with him and goes away.  <br/> He is despaired up to the point of considering leaving the child in a drain. After discarding that option, he realises that there is a note among the baby's clothes. It says: ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". Chaplin, moved by these words, starts feeling bad about the poor baby. He decides finally to do what the note says and takes the child with him."

Chaplin	written_online	20.0	Outside classroom		This film, called The baby, was made by Charles Chaplin and released in 1921 in the USA. <br/> As we can see at the beginning, the main character is going through one street where rubbish is being thrown. These citizens who are carrying out this activity are neither aware nor worried about the fact that anyone might be passing by. We are shown this evidence as Chaplin avoids the first one but ends up being thrown the garbage of another person. After this event, which provoked his cigarette falling down, he decides to take another and start to smoke it. This having been done, he finds a baby left on the floor. At first, he thinks he might have been dropped from one of the windows by accident. When he sees a woman with a cart and baby, he thinks the child is hers, so he goes closer to her and tries to leave him in the cart. However, the woman appears after having left the cart and tells him that he is not her son. <br/> Then, he returns to the place where he found him and tries to abandon him, but a policeman shows up. When Chaplin realises that he has witnessed his act, he takes the baby again and leaves.  <br/> Now in another street, Chaplin finds an old man and thinks this is a perfect opportunity to get rid of the baby. Then, he lies to the man and runs away as the old man shouts at him. Chaplin having left, the man moves on to another street with the baby, where he finds the cart of the woman seen before in the movie, and leaves the child there. At this moment, Chaplin, who thought everything was over, reappears, but he is noticed by the woman, who has discovered the unknown baby in her chart. She then hits him and tells him off because she thought he had been the one who had left the baby in the cart. <br/> After this funny episode, Chaplin moves on to another place of the city and sits down on the pavement. When examining the child, he finds out a piece of paper, where he reads that the author begs of the person who found the child love and care towards him. Eventually, he decides to look after the child and the film ends.		{'This': 2, 'film': 2, ',': 27, 'called': 1, 'The': 1, 'baby': 8, 'was': 2, 'made': 1, 'by': 4, 'Charles': 1, 'Chaplin': 7, 'and': 14, 'released': 1, 'in': 7, '1921': 1, 'the': 36, 'USA': 1, '.': 19, '<': 4, 'br/': 4, '>': 4, 'As': 1, 'we': 1, 'can': 1, 'see': 1, 'at': 2, 'beginning': 1, 'main': 1, 'character': 1, 'is': 6, 'going': 1, 'through': 1, 'one': 4, 'street': 3, 'where': 4, 'rubbish': 1, 'being': 2, 'thrown': 2, 'These': 1, 'citizens': 1, 'who': 5, 'are': 3, 'carrying': 1, 'out': 2, 'this': 6, 'activity': 1, 'neither': 1, 'aware': 1, 'nor': 1, 'worried': 1, 'about': 1, 'fact': 1, 'that': 4, 'anyone': 1, 'might': 2, 'be': 1, 'passing': 1, 'We': 1, 'shown': 1, 'evidence': 1, 'as': 2, 'avoids': 1, 'first': 2, 'but': 3, 'ends': 2, 'up': 2, 'garbage': 1, 'of': 7, 'another': 5, 'person': 2, 'After': 2, 'event': 1, 'which': 1, 'provoked': 1, 'his': 2, 'cigarette': 1, 'falling': 1, 'down': 2, 'he': 19, 'decides': 2, 'to': 11, 'take': 1, 'start': 1, 'smoke': 1, 'it': 1, 'having': 3, 'been': 3, 'done': 1, 'finds': 4, 'a': 6, 'left': 4, 'on': 4, 'floor': 1, 'At': 2, 'thinks': 3, 'have': 1, 'dropped': 1, 'from': 1, 'windows': 1, 'accident': 1, 'When': 3, 'sees': 1, 'woman': 4, 'with': 2, 'cart': 5, 'child': 5, 'hers': 1, 'so': 1, 'goes': 1, 'closer': 1, 'her': 3, 'tries': 2, 'leave': 1, 'him': 8, 'However': 1, 'appears': 1, 'after': 2, 'tells': 2, 'not': 1, 'son': 1, 'Then': 2, 'returns': 1, 'place': 2, 'found': 2, 'abandon': 1, 'policeman': 1, 'shows': 1, 'realises': 1, 'has': 2, 'witnessed': 1, 'act': 1, 'takes': 1, 'again': 1, 'leaves': 2, ' ': 1, 'Now': 1, 'an': 1, 'old': 2, 'man': 4, 'perfect': 1, 'opportunity': 1, 'get': 1, 'rid': 1, 'lies': 1, 'runs': 1, 'away': 1, 'shouts': 1, 'moves': 2, 'seen': 1, 'before': 1, 'movie': 1, 'there': 1, 'moment': 1, 'thought': 2, 'everything': 1, 'over': 1, 'reappears': 1, 'noticed': 1, 'discovered': 1, 'unknown': 1, 'chart': 1, 'She': 1, 'then': 1, 'hits': 1, 'off': 1, 'because': 1, 'she': 1, 'had': 2, 'funny': 1, 'episode': 1, 'city': 1, 'sits': 1, 'pavement': 1, 'examining': 1, 'piece': 1, 'paper': 1, 'reads': 1, 'author': 1, 'begs': 1, 'love': 1, 'care': 1, 'towards': 1, 'Eventually': 1, 'look': 1}	{'DET': 55, 'NOUN': 66, 'PUNCT': 46, 'VERB': 68, 'AUX': 29, 'ADP': 46, 'PROPN': 11, 'CCONJ': 18, 'NUM': 5, 'X': 9, 'SCONJ': 15, 'PRON': 48, 'ADJ': 9, 'ADV': 17, 'PART': 7, 'SPACE': 1}

He soon saw a woman with a stroller and thought that baby was hers, so he put it in; however this was not the case and she gave it back to Chaplin. He then put the baby back where he found it but a police officer caught him red-handed so Chaplin picked it up again. He kept on walking until he saw an old man with a walking stick and left the baby with him. This old man found the  lady with the stroller and put them back in. Chaplin passed by and the lady thought it had been him again who had left the baby there, so she hit him with her umbrella and made him take the baby back. Finally, Chaplin was sitting and found a note in the baby's clothes which said to love and take care of them, and so did Chaplin.

Chaplin	written_online	15.0	Outside classroom		Chaplin is walking down a street, smoking cigarettes taken from the floor and angry because people are throwing their rubbish through the window. Suddenly, he finds a baby on the floor, looks around, and sees no one, so he decides to pick the baby up. He walks holding the baby and sees a woman who appears to be looking for something, and Chaplin puts the baby he had found on the woman's trolley, in front of the woman's child that was already on it. However, it seems the baby found by Chaplin is not the one the woman was looking for, so she reacts violently against him and makes him go away with the baby. Then, Chaplin decides to leave it where he found it, but, right when he was about to do so, a police officer appears and Chaplin has no option but to pick it up again to avoid having problems with the police man. Chaplin then walks again holding the baby, and to get rid of it, he tricks an old man pretending he ties his shoes while Chaplin makes him hold the baby, but runs away insted. Due to a series of some funny coincidences, Chaplin has problems again with the woman he had met before, and with the police man as well. Next, he sits on the sidewalk, thinking what to do, and finds a note within the baby's clothes that says it is an orphan baby. Eventually, he realises the baby has no home or family, and that it is not lost, and he finally decides to keep it.

After that, he gets out of his pocket a metal box from which he takes a cigarrette end that he lights and starts to smoke. He intends to continue walking, but a baby wrapped in sheets calls his attention. He takes the child in his arms and thinks what to do while a woman passes by with a baby trolley and goes towards her, thinking that was her baby. But it wasn't, so the woman angrily tells him to take the kid and go and so does Chaplin. His next idea is to leave the kid in the same spot he found him, so whoever had lost him could find him, but a police officer sees him and thinks he is abandoning the baby so he takes him again and leaves. Desperate, he finds a man to whom he asks to grab the baby and, while he pretends to tie his shoelaces, runs away and hides. At the same time, the other man leaves the baby in a baby trolley he finds in the street, which is by chance the same woman's one. Chaplin gets out of his hideout and when the woman sees him, she hits him repeatedly and starts arguing with him to take the child. In that moment, the policeman comes and Chaplin is forced to take the baby again. At the end Chaplin sits to think what to do and finds between the baby's sheets a note asking to take care of him since he is an orphan. Chaplin gets up and finally walks away with the baby.

Then, he takes a cigarette. While he's smoking, he sees a baby on the street. He takes it and looks for someone who could have left it there. As he doesn't find anybody, he leaves the baby in a pram he notices. But the pram's woman complains and holds him the baby again. He tries to abandon it on the street, where he found it, but a police man sees him, so he tries to escape, not to get caught by the police man. After that, he leaves the baby with a man, who puts the baby into the previously mentioned pram, and the pram's woman gives the baby to Chaplin for a second time. Eventually, Chaplin sits down and looks at the baby while holding it, when he notices about a hidden paper in the baby clothes. He takes it and reads the message written: the baby is an orphan kid.

Chaplin	written_online	30.0	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (Spanish/English)	At the beginning of the video we see Chaplin walking in a relay dirty street where people seem to be throwing rubbish from the windows of the buildings.  As he keeps walking some of the rubbish falls on him. He opens a metal box in which we see several almost finished cigars. He chooses one and lights it. At some point he sees a baby laying on the floor, next to more rubbish. He is quite surprised and looks at the windows wondering if anybody has thrown the baby from a window. He takes the baby in his arms and tries to figure out what to do with it. Then, when a woman with a stroller passes by, Chaplin leaves the baby inside the stroller. However, as soon as the woman realises this, she scolds him and Chaplin has to take the baby again. Later on, he tries to leave the baby on the floor where he had found it but the presence of a police man makes him keep the baby. After that, he tricks someone to hold the baby and runs away. This man who is now holding the child decides to leave it in the same stroller as Chaplin did before. Hence, when the woman with the stoller sees Chaplin, she beats him up and returns the baby to him (now Chaplin cannot get rid of the baby as the same police officer is watching him).  At the end Chaplin sits in the street beside a sewer with the baby in his arms. He watches the gutter considering if the baby would fit in there but decides to keep it in his arms. When he is looking at the baby, he finds some money and a letter in its clothes. The letter says “Please love and care for this orphan child”. So, we see how Caplin gets emotional and decides to keep the baby. He gets up with a smile on his face and leaves.		{'At': 3, 'the': 32, 'beginning': 1, 'of': 5, 'video': 1, 'we': 3, 'see': 3, 'Chaplin': 7, 'walking': 2, 'in': 9, 'a': 10, 'relay': 1, 'dirty': 1, 'street': 2, 'where': 2, 'people': 1, 'seem': 1, 'to': 11, 'be': 1, 'throwing': 1, 'rubbish': 3, 'from': 2, 'windows': 2, 'buildings': 1, '.': 19, ' ': 2, 'As': 1, 'he': 7, 'keeps': 1, 'some': 3, 'falls': 1, 'on': 5, 'him': 6, 'He': 6, 'opens': 1, 'metal': 1, 'box': 1, 'which': 1, 'several': 1, 'almost': 1, 'finished': 1, 'cigars': 1, 'chooses': 1, 'one': 1, 'and': 10, 'lights': 1, 'it': 5, 'point': 1, 'sees': 2, 'baby': 14, 'laying': 1, 'floor': 2, ',': 11, 'next': 1, 'more': 1, 'is': 4, 'quite': 1, 'surprised': 1, 'looks': 1, 'at': 2, 'wondering': 1, 'if': 2, 'anybody': 1, 'has': 2, 'thrown': 1, 'window': 1, 'takes': 1, 'his': 4, 'arms': 3, 'tries': 2, 'figure': 1, 'out': 1, 'what': 1, 'do': 1, 'with': 5, 'Then': 1, 'when': 2, 'woman': 3, 'stroller': 3, 'passes': 1, 'by': 1, 'leaves': 2, 'inside': 1, 'However': 1, 'as': 4, 'soon': 1, 'realises': 1, 'this': 2, 'she': 2, 'scolds': 1, 'take': 1, 'again': 1, 'Later': 1, 'leave': 2, 'had': 1, 'found': 1, 'but': 2, 'presence': 1, 'police': 2, 'man': 2, 'makes': 1, 'keep': 3, 'After': 1, 'that': 1, 'tricks': 1, 'someone': 1, 'hold': 1, 'runs': 1, 'away': 1, 'This': 1, 'who': 1, 'now': 2, 'holding': 1, 'child': 2, 'decides': 3, 'same': 2, 'did': 1, 'before': 1, 'Hence': 1, 'stoller': 1, 'beats': 1, 'up': 2, 'returns': 1, '(': 1, 'can': 1, 'not': 1, 'get': 1, 'rid': 1, 'officer': 1, 'watching': 1, ')': 1, 'end': 1, 'sits': 1, 'beside': 1, 'sewer': 1, 'watches': 1, 'gutter': 1, 'considering': 1, 'would': 1, 'fit': 1, 'there': 1, 'When': 1, 'looking': 1, 'finds': 1, 'money': 1, 'letter': 2, 'its': 1, 'clothes': 1, 'The': 1, 'says': 1, '“': 1, 'Please': 1, 'love': 1, 'care': 1, 'for': 1, 'orphan': 1, '”': 1, 'So': 1, 'how': 1, 'Caplin': 1, 'gets': 2, 'emotional': 1, 'smile': 1, 'face': 1}	{'ADP': 39, 'DET': 47, 'NOUN': 62, 'PRON': 42, 'VERB': 59, 'PROPN': 8, 'ADJ': 8, 'SCONJ': 12, 'PART': 10, 'AUX': 10, 'PUNCT': 34, 'SPACE': 2, 'ADV': 18, 'NUM': 1, 'CCONJ': 12, 'INTJ': 1}

Chaplin	written_online	5.0	Inside classroom		One day Chaplin was walking down the street when, suddenly, someone threw a bag of garbage at him. He stopped to light a cigar and, when he was about to leave, he saw a baby next to the trashcan. He decided to pick it up and find the person who had left him there. In that moment, a woman with a baby stroller was passing by, and he thought that it was hers', so he walked to her and left it in there. However, it wasn't hers', and she started yelling at him. He decided to run with the baby and leave it where he found it, but the police showed up at that moment and he had to pick it up again. As he saw that there was no way to leave it behind, he decided to trick an old man by asking him to grab the baby while he tied his shoes, and then run away. The old man found the woman Chaplin had seen before and left the baby in her stroller again. When Chaplin thought the problem was solved, he passed by the woman again, and she called the police, so he had to take the baby again. Hopeless, he sat in the street walk and thought about dropping him in the sewer, but then he found a note in the baby's blanket. He then realized that he was alone in the world and that it was destiny that put it in his life.

Suddenly, while he is walking through an alley, some debris falls from a building. He shakes off the dirt from his clothes and lights on a cigarette. While doing so, he finds a baby on the floor. Confused, he picks up the baby. He sees a woman passing by with a baby trolley for twins, so he decides to put the baby he has found next to the woman's. When she sees him doing so, she yells at him and tells him to take that baby away. He decides to put the baby back where he found him, in the alley, but he realises there is a policeman looking at him, so he takes it back from the street again. He sees a lame man using a walking stick passing by, and with the excuse that he is going to tie up his shoelaces, he gives the baby to the man, and then runs away. The man runs after him, but Charles Chaplin hides so he doesn't see him. The man then sees the same baby trolley Chaplin had seen before, and decides to put the baby there. The woman realises the baby is there again, and coincidentally Chaplin is passing by, so she yells at him. The policeman sees the two of them arguing so he goes to bring peace. Charles Chaplin is forced to take the baby again. Not knowing what to do with him, he sits on the sidewalk and considers throwing the baby down the drain, but does not do so in the end. He finds a paper between the baby clothes that reads: 'Please love and care for this orphan child'. So, in the end, moved by that note, he decides to keep the baby.

When he is about to set his journey again, his attention is driven to a baby lying on the floor, all wrapped up in blankets. He then sees a woman with a stroller, and he decides to follow her carting the baby in his arms. He tries to make the woman believe that she has dropped the baby out od the stroller, but she does not seem very convinced about that idea as she starts yelling at Chaplin. Then he returns to the same place the flowerpot landed on and he restored the baby to where he found him or her.  <br/>  <br/> At that very moment, a police officer sees Chaplin leaving the baby behind and so Chaplin decides to take the baby with him. As he strolls down the road, he pretends to need to lace his shoes and he entrusts the baby to a man in the street. When that man is distracted with the baby, Chaplin escapes and hides from the man who is chasing him. This latter man also sees that very same woman from before and leaves the baby in the stroller once again, but the woman thinks that it was Chaplin who put the baby inside the stroller and not the bearded man. After being beaten up with an umbrella, Chaplin takes the baby once more, but this time under the watchful eye of the police officer and he leaves.  <br/>  <br/> Chaplin, resigned, sits down on the pavement, and takes a letter from the wrapped baby. The letter says: “Please love and care for this orphan child”. It seems that Chaplin was moved by this short note as he leaves with the baby in his arms.		{'There': 1, 'is': 6, 'a': 10, 'man': 6, 'walking': 1, 'down': 4, 'the': 32, 'street': 2, 'and': 12, ',': 17, 'suddenly': 1, 'flowerpot': 2, 'crashes': 1, 'on': 4, 'ground': 1, 'right': 1, 'in': 7, 'front': 1, 'of': 4, 'him': 4, '.': 15, 'As': 2, 'he': 14, 'grunting': 1, 'about': 3, 'what': 1, 'has': 2, 'just': 1, 'happened': 1, 'takes': 3, 'cigarette': 1, 'butt': 2, 'out': 2, 'tin': 1, 'box': 1, 'keeps': 1, 'his': 8, 'pocket': 1, 'After': 2, 'taking': 1, 'gloves': 1, 'off': 1, 'lights': 1, 'matchstick': 1, 'with': 6, 'sole': 1, 'shoe': 1, 'starts': 2, 'smoking': 1, 'When': 2, 'to': 10, 'set': 1, 'journey': 1, 'again': 2, 'attention': 1, 'driven': 1, 'baby': 13, 'lying': 1, 'floor': 1, 'all': 1, 'wrapped': 2, 'up': 2, 'blankets': 1, 'He': 2, 'then': 1, 'sees': 3, 'woman': 4, 'stroller': 4, 'decides': 2, 'follow': 1, 'her': 2, 'carting': 1, 'arms': 2, 'tries': 1, 'make': 1, 'believe': 1, 'that': 7, 'she': 3, 'dropped': 1, 'od': 1, 'but': 3, 'does': 1, 'not': 2, 'seem': 1, 'very': 3, 'convinced': 1, 'idea': 1, 'as': 2, 'yelling': 1, 'at': 1, 'Chaplin': 8, 'Then': 1, 'returns': 1, 'same': 2, 'place': 1, 'landed': 1, 'restored': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'or': 1, ' ': 4, '<': 4, 'br/': 4, '>': 4, 'At': 1, 'moment': 1, 'police': 2, 'officer': 2, 'leaving': 1, 'behind': 1, 'so': 1, 'take': 1, 'strolls': 1, 'road': 1, 'pretends': 1, 'need': 1, 'lace': 1, 'shoes': 1, 'entrusts': 1, 'distracted': 1, 'escapes': 1, 'hides': 1, 'from': 3, 'who': 2, 'chasing': 1, 'This': 1, 'latter': 1, 'also': 1, 'before': 1, 'leaves': 3, 'once': 2, 'thinks': 1, 'it': 1, 'was': 2, 'put': 1, 'inside': 1, 'bearded': 1, 'being': 1, 'beaten': 1, 'an': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'more': 1, 'this': 3, 'time': 1, 'under': 1, 'watchful': 1, 'eye': 1, 'resigned': 1, 'sits': 1, 'pavement': 1, 'letter': 2, 'The': 1, 'says': 1, ':': 1, '“': 1, 'Please': 1, 'love': 1, 'care': 1, 'for': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'child': 1, '”': 1, 'It': 1, 'seems': 1, 'moved': 1, 'by': 1, 'short': 1, 'note': 1}	{'PRON': 40, 'VERB': 59, 'DET': 51, 'NOUN': 68, 'ADP': 48, 'CCONJ': 16, 'PUNCT': 35, 'ADV': 16, 'SCONJ': 11, 'AUX': 11, 'ADJ': 9, 'PART': 8, 'PROPN': 12, 'SPACE': 4, 'X': 8, 'INTJ': 1}

After this, he realises that there is a baby on the floor. He looks around confused and takes him. Chaplin observes there is a woman with a buggy and another baby, so he approaches her and places the baby inside it with the other child. However, the woman gets mad because the baby is not hers. Then, Chaplin takes the baby back to the place where he found him and leaves him on the floor. While he is leaving the baby, a policeman is watching him, so Chaplin takes the child back. Following this, he starts walking again holding the baby. He gives the creature to an old man, pretending he is going to lace his shoes, and runs away. This old man, confused as well, leaves the baby in the buggy again and he goes away. The mother comes out and looks surprised at the child. Then, she sees Chaplin walking by and assumes he was the one who left the baby again, so she hits him with an umbrella. The policeman comes and Chaplin ends up taking the baby. He sits on the floor while holding the child and thinks of putting him into a drain. Afterwards, he reads a note the baby had in his blanket. It sort of touches him and thus, he finally decides to take care of him.		{'The': 3, 'video': 1, 'starts': 2, 'with': 4, 'Charles': 1, 'Chaplin': 6, 'taking': 2, 'a': 7, 'walk': 1, 'and': 12, 'he': 11, 'gets': 2, 'hit': 1, 'by': 2, 'something': 1, 'due': 1, 'to': 5, 'some': 1, 'works': 1, 'that': 2, 'are': 1, 'being': 1, 'done': 1, 'in': 3, 'the': 22, 'houses': 1, 'nearby': 1, '.': 16, 'After': 1, 'this': 2, ',': 15, 'realises': 1, 'there': 2, 'is': 6, 'baby': 11, 'on': 3, 'floor': 3, 'He': 3, 'looks': 2, 'around': 1, 'confused': 2, 'takes': 3, 'him': 8, 'observes': 1, 'woman': 2, 'buggy': 2, 'another': 1, 'so': 3, 'approaches': 1, 'her': 1, 'places': 1, 'inside': 1, 'it': 1, 'other': 1, 'child': 4, 'However': 1, 'mad': 1, 'because': 1, 'not': 1, 'hers': 1, 'Then': 2, 'back': 2, 'place': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'leaves': 2, 'While': 1, 'leaving': 1, 'policeman': 2, 'watching': 1, 'Following': 1, 'walking': 2, 'again': 3, 'holding': 2, 'gives': 1, 'creature': 1, 'an': 2, 'old': 2, 'man': 2, 'pretending': 1, 'going': 1, 'lace': 1, 'his': 2, 'shoes': 1, 'runs': 1, 'away': 2, 'This': 1, 'as': 1, 'well': 1, 'goes': 1, 'mother': 1, 'comes': 2, 'out': 1, 'surprised': 1, 'at': 1, 'she': 2, 'sees': 1, 'assumes': 1, 'was': 1, 'one': 1, 'who': 1, 'left': 1, 'hits': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'ends': 1, 'up': 1, 'sits': 1, 'while': 1, 'thinks': 1, 'of': 3, 'putting': 1, 'into': 1, 'drain': 1, 'Afterwards': 1, 'reads': 1, 'note': 1, 'had': 1, 'blanket': 1, 'It': 1, 'sort': 1, 'touches': 1, 'thus': 1, 'finally': 1, 'decides': 1, 'take': 1, 'care': 1}	{'DET': 37, 'NOUN': 38, 'VERB': 50, 'ADP': 23, 'PROPN': 7, 'CCONJ': 12, 'PRON': 36, 'AUX': 8, 'ADJ': 9, 'ADV': 22, 'PUNCT': 31, 'SCONJ': 5, 'PART': 3, 'NUM': 1}

Chaplin	written_online	15.0	Outside classroom		Chaplin is walking as a builder throws rubble from an apartment above. He cleans the dust off of himself and continues walking and smoking a cigar. Suddenly, someone throws rubbish to him from above. He stops, swears at the person above and takes a can out of his pocket that contains several half-smoked cigars. He takes one, lights a match with the sole of his shoe and throws his gloves to the bin. He looks to the left to discover a crying baby who has been abandoned on the street. He approaches and checks on him. Then, he looks at the surrounding buildings looking for the possible parents of the child. After seeing nobody, he decides to grab him while a woman with a trolley passes by. Chaplin notices the woman and chases her. When the woman stops to enter one of the houses, Chaplin leaves the child on the woman’s trolley just to see her come back yelling at Chaplin. The woman tells Chaplin, very angrily, that the baby is not hers, so Chaplin grabs the baby again and the woman leaves. Chaplin returns to where he found the baby and leaves him/her there again. When he turns around, he bumps into an officer and immediately turns around to take the baby and leave. As he is walking by, he sees an old man walking with a stick. Chaplin tells the man to hold the baby while he ties his shoe. When the man holds the baby, Chaplin pretends to tie his left shoe and a second after he runs away, leaving the man with the baby. The man chases Chaplin, who hides in a small room next to where the baby was found. The old man, not being able to find Chaplin, leaves the baby on the woman’s trolley. Chaplin exits the room where he was hiding and comes across another officer. He turns around and leaves. In the next scene, two people walk by the trolley and the woman goes out of the shop. The woman sees the baby on the trolley and shows herself incredulously. Chaplin passes by the woman, who takes an umbrella and runs to him. She starts to beat him with the umbrella. She grabs him by the jacket and takes him to the trolley. They start an argument about the baby and the woman calls an officer. The woman explains the situation to the officer and Chaplin takes the baby again, without the officer telling him to. They all leave. Chaplin walks on the sidewalk and drops his stick next to a drain. Then, he sits on the sidewalk to pick up the stick. He opens the drain and looks at the baby, thinking about dropping him inside. He frowns and closes the drain. He stares at the baby and starts talking to him/her. When the changes the baby to his right lap, Chaplin stabs himself with a pin that is on the baby’s blanket. He looks into the folds of the blanket and finds a note, which was held with the pin. He takes out the note and pokes the pin on his blazer. He unfolds the note, which reads “please love and care for this orphan child”. Chaplin, moved by the note, looks at the baby and keeps the note in a pocket of his blazer. He starts smiling at the baby, takes his stick and they both leave.		{'Chaplin': 17, 'is': 4, 'walking': 4, 'as': 1, 'a': 14, 'builder': 1, 'throws': 3, 'rubble': 1, 'from': 2, 'an': 6, 'apartment': 1, 'above': 3, '.': 40, 'He': 13, 'cleans': 1, 'the': 65, 'dust': 1, 'off': 1, 'of': 8, 'himself': 2, 'and': 28, 'continues': 1, 'smoking': 1, 'cigar': 1, 'Suddenly': 1, ',': 27, 'someone': 1, 'rubbish': 1, 'to': 22, 'him': 11, 'stops': 2, 'swears': 1, 'at': 7, 'person': 1, 'takes': 7, 'can': 1, 'out': 3, 'his': 10, 'pocket': 2, 'that': 3, 'contains': 1, 'several': 1, 'half': 1, '-': 1, 'smoked': 1, 'cigars': 1, 'one': 2, 'lights': 1, 'match': 1, 'with': 7, 'sole': 1, 'shoe': 3, 'gloves': 1, 'bin': 1, 'looks': 5, 'left': 2, 'discover': 1, 'crying': 1, 'baby': 19, 'who': 3, 'has': 1, 'been': 1, 'abandoned': 1, 'on': 9, 'street': 1, 'approaches': 1, 'checks': 1, 'Then': 2, 'he': 11, 'surrounding': 1, 'buildings': 1, 'looking': 1, 'for': 2, 'possible': 1, 'parents': 1, 'child': 3, 'After': 1, 'seeing': 1, 'nobody': 1, 'decides': 1, 'grab': 1, 'while': 2, 'woman': 12, 'trolley': 6, 'passes': 2, 'by': 6, 'notices': 1, 'chases': 2, 'her': 4, 'When': 4, 'enter': 1, 'houses': 1, 'leaves': 5, '’s': 3, 'just': 1, 'see': 1, 'come': 1, 'back': 1, 'yelling': 1, 'The': 5, 'tells': 2, 'very': 1, 'angrily': 1, 'not': 2, 'hers': 1, 'so': 1, 'grabs': 2, 'again': 3, 'returns': 1, 'where': 3, 'found': 2, '/': 2, 'there': 1, 'turns': 3, 'around': 3, 'bumps': 1, 'into': 2, 'officer': 5, 'immediately': 1, 'take': 1, 'leave': 3, 'As': 1, 'sees': 2, 'old': 2, 'man': 6, 'stick': 4, 'hold': 1, 'ties': 1, 'holds': 1, 'pretends': 1, 'tie': 1, 'second': 1, 'after': 1, 'runs': 2, 'away': 1, 'leaving': 1, 'hides': 1, 'in': 2, 'small': 1, 'room': 2, 'next': 3, 'was': 3, 'being': 1, 'able': 1, 'find': 1, 'exits': 1, 'hiding': 1, 'comes': 1, 'across': 1, 'another': 1, 'In': 1, 'scene': 1, 'two': 1, 'people': 1, 'walk': 1, 'goes': 1, 'shop': 1, 'shows': 1, 'herself': 1, 'incredulously': 1, 'umbrella': 2, 'She': 2, 'starts': 3, 'beat': 1, 'jacket': 1, 'They': 2, 'start': 1, 'argument': 1, 'about': 2, 'calls': 1, 'explains': 1, 'situation': 1, 'without': 1, 'telling': 1, 'all': 1, 'walks': 1, 'sidewalk': 2, 'drops': 1, 'drain': 3, 'sits': 1, 'pick': 1, 'up': 1, 'opens': 1, 'thinking': 1, 'dropping': 1, 'inside': 1, 'frowns': 1, 'closes': 1, 'stares': 1, 'talking': 1, 'changes': 1, 'right': 1, 'lap': 1, 'stabs': 1, 'pin': 3, 'blanket': 2, 'folds': 1, 'finds': 1, 'note': 5, 'which': 2, 'held': 1, 'pokes': 1, 'blazer': 2, 'unfolds': 1, 'reads': 1, '“': 1, 'please': 1, 'love': 1, 'care': 1, 'this': 1, 'orphan': 1, '”': 1, 'moved': 1, 'keeps': 1, 'smiling': 1, 'they': 1, 'both': 1}	{'PROPN': 17, 'AUX': 10, 'VERB': 114, 'SCONJ': 13, 'DET': 92, 'NOUN': 110, 'ADP': 68, 'ADV': 24, 'PUNCT': 70, 'PRON': 68, 'CCONJ': 28, 'ADJ': 12, 'NUM': 3, 'PART': 15, 'SYM': 2, 'INTJ': 1}

First, a person was throwing things out of the window and they almost fell on him luckily he was able to avoid being hit. Then as he was walking away while smoking a cigarette someone else threw something out of their window and part of it hit chaplin, he just wiped himself and lid another cigarrete and threw away his gloves. When he was about to leave he saw a crying baby laying on the floor next to a dumpster, chaplin looked around to see who had dropped him and picked him up. He saw a lady with a stroller and he called out to her but she just ignored him and went into a building, so chaplin just put the baby into the stroller and walked away, but the lady started yelling at him to take the baby back and he was pointing that he found him back there but she was not listening to him, so chaplin took the baby out of the stroller and walked back to where he found him. He was about to put him back in the ground when he saw a policeman, so he just grabbed the baby and took him with him, and he saw an old man walking and made him hold the baby while he ¨tied his shoe¨and chaplin ran away leaving the baby witht he old man. The old man put the baby in a stroller where chaplin had already attempeted to leave the baby, and the old man ran away.

First of all, it is a silent and black and white film which was a very typical thing in those years. The scene stars with Chaplin in the street where he found a baby lying on the floor. Then, a policeman thought that the baby belonged to Chaplin so he had to pick up the baby from the floor. After a while, Chaplin tried many times to get rid of the baby but he did not. Eventually, he found a note where said that the baby was an orphan one, so he decided to take care of him. Through the whole scene, it can be seen that the first option for the actor is to leave the baby wherever. Besides, the first part is more like a comedian one, although when he realised that is an orphan child, the scene is more dramatic.		{'This': 1, 'video': 1, 'shows': 1, 'a': 9, 'peculiar': 1, 'situation': 1, 'where': 3, 'the': 14, 'main': 1, 'characters': 1, 'are': 1, 'Chaplin': 4, 'and': 3, 'baby': 7, '.': 8, 'First': 1, 'of': 3, 'all': 1, ',': 9, 'it': 2, 'is': 5, 'silent': 1, 'black': 1, 'white': 1, 'film': 1, 'which': 1, 'was': 2, 'very': 1, 'typical': 1, 'thing': 1, 'in': 2, 'those': 1, 'years': 1, 'The': 1, 'scene': 3, 'stars': 1, 'with': 1, 'street': 1, 'he': 6, 'found': 2, 'lying': 1, 'on': 1, 'floor': 2, 'Then': 1, 'policeman': 1, 'thought': 1, 'that': 4, 'belonged': 1, 'to': 5, 'so': 2, 'had': 1, 'pick': 1, 'up': 1, 'from': 1, 'After': 1, 'while': 1, 'tried': 1, 'many': 1, 'times': 1, 'get': 1, 'rid': 1, 'but': 1, 'did': 1, 'not': 1, 'Eventually': 1, 'note': 1, 'said': 1, 'an': 2, 'orphan': 2, 'one': 2, 'decided': 1, 'take': 1, 'care': 1, 'him': 1, 'Through': 1, 'whole': 1, 'can': 1, 'be': 1, 'seen': 1, 'first': 2, 'option': 1, 'for': 1, 'actor': 1, 'leave': 1, 'wherever': 1, 'Besides': 1, 'part': 1, 'more': 2, 'like': 1, 'comedian': 1, 'although': 1, 'when': 1, 'realised': 1, 'child': 1, 'dramatic': 1}	{'DET': 28, 'NOUN': 32, 'VERB': 18, 'ADJ': 12, 'SCONJ': 8, 'AUX': 11, 'PROPN': 4, 'CCONJ': 4, 'PUNCT': 17, 'ADV': 10, 'ADP': 14, 'PRON': 12, 'PART': 5}

He cleaned himself and then chose a cigarette to smoke.  <br/> After this, he was continuing his walk, when he suddenly saw an abandoned baby near the trash. He didn't know who the parents were so he started looking around until he found out a woman with a baby cart. He dediced to leave the baby there thinking, maybe, it was hers. However, when the woman found out, she started yelling at him. It seems that it wasn't hers. <br/> Because the man didn't know what to do with the baby, he went to the same place he found it to leave it there. Suddenly, a policeman appered so he couldn't do that. He left the place and saw an old man walking. He gave the baby to the old man and run off.  <br/> The old man dind't wanted the baby so he walked until he found a baby cart (the same as before) and leave the baby there when the mother wasn't looking. With all the bad luck, the man was walking in the street when the mother descovered the baby. She chased him and yelled at him. In this moment, the policeman appeared and started yealling at him too. <br/> In the end, he picked up the baby and took it with him. He sat down in the street and found a letter inside the baby's clothes that asked to please take care of that orphan baby. He then, realizing it didn't have a family smiled at the baby and took it home with him.

He believes this child belongs to a woman who walks by him with another child but she is not the child's mother. Confused, Charles returns the baby to the spot where he found him but a policeman sees him so Charles decides to take the baby again. He tricks one man giving him the baby and runs away. Then, this man does the same and gives the baby to the woman that appeared before with another child and he runs away too. Suddenly, Charles appears in the same street where this woman is and she starts beating Charles until the policeman arrives again. Charles then decides to keep the baby and sits down when he finds a paper sticked to the baby's clothes saying to care and love the orphan child, which makes Charles keep the baby in the end.

While he was doing so, he saw a baby wrapped in blankets lying nearby. He picked up the baby and started looking around looking for his parents. He saw a woman walking by with a baby cart and thought that the baby was probably hers. As soon as he placed the baby in the cart, the woman started yelling at and hitting him because it wasn't hers. Then, Chaplin decided to leave again the baby where he had found it but a policeman saw it and Chaplin picked the baby up again. Afterwards, he made a man sustain it while he supposedly tie up his shoes and ran away. The man encountered the woman at the beginning of the story, placed the baby in the cart and ran away.  A bit later, the woman discovered the baby again in the cart and as she saw Chaplin walking nearby called the police and explained the situation. Chaplin picked up the baby again and after walking some time he sat down on the street thinking what he should do with the baby now. In that moment, he found a little note between the blankets that said that the baby was an orphan and asked whoever founded the baby to take care of him. After that, Chaplin smiled and decided to adopt him.

His cigarette is extinguished from one of these episodes, so he gets another cigarette from his pocket. He lights it and continues walking, but he suddenly hears a baby crying. The baby is lying on the ground, so Chaplin takes it. He looks for the person who might have left the baby there, but since he cannot see anybody else, he leaves the baby in a buggy. However, the woman who owns it sees Chaplin leaving the baby there and starts yelling at him. Chaplin takes the baby from the buggy and starts wondering again. He was going to put the baby back where he found it when a police officer came by and ordered him to keep the baby. Chaplin started walking with the baby when he saw an old man, to whom he tricked to get rid of the baby. Chaplin ran off to hide somewhere. In the meanwhile, the old man left the baby in the buggy where Chaplin had first left the baby. The woman did not see this old man leaving the baby in her buggy, so, later, when she saw Chaplin again, she blamed him. The police officer was around, and she told him about what she thought Chaplin had done. The police officer told him off and obliged him to take the baby with him. Chaplin, hopeless, sat down on the street. He was staring at the baby when he found a note wrapped in the baby's clothes, which said that the baby was an orphan, and asked the person reading it to love and take care or it. Chaplin smiled, stood up and left the scene with the baby.

At the beginning of the video, Chaplin leaves a building, and not far from there, he has a little accident with what it seems to be ruins of a construction. Later, this man decides to smoke a cigarette, and so he takes one from a box from inside his coat and lights the cigarette with his shoe. When he starts walking again, he finds a little baby on the corner of the street. He decides to pick up the baby and put it inside a chariot he finds not far from there. When the woman returns and finds out someone has put a baby inside, she immediately starts to what it seems shouting at Chaplin. Then, this man takes back the baby he had found and tries to put it back where he was. However, a police officer appears on the scene, so again, Chaplin picks up the baby, and this time he gives it to another man. This new man takes the baby, and he find the chariot of the previous scene and tries the same thing Chaplin had done. The man leaves the scene and when the woman finds out about the baby, Chaplin happens to be walking passed her, and so he's blamed for this action. The protagonist decides to take the baby with him and sits on the boarder of the pavement considering to put the baby inside the sewer but this only lasts for a few seconds in his mind.

After this, he decides to leave the baby where he found him, but there is a police man watching, making him leave and take the child with him. Consequently, he asks a man to hold the child while he ties the laces of his shoes, but this is just an excuse to run away and leave him the baby.

Later on, he sees a woman pushing a stroller and he tries to put the baby inside, although the woman does not let him do it.  As he cannot find the right place for the baby, he then decides to leave the baby where he found it, laying on the floor. Sadly for him, a policeman catches him red handed, which means he has to keep the baby again. Afterwards, he tricks a lame into holding the baby so that he can run away. The poor lame finds himself with a baby and, not knowing what to do, he leaves the baby in a stroller, which happens to be the same stroller as before. When the woman finds two babies in her stroller, she thinks Chaplin is to blame for abandoning the child and beats him up for this reason. After all this awful series of events, he finds a note in between the baby's clothes saying that he is an orphan. It is only now that Chaplin decides to keep the baby.

Then, someone appears in a window and throws the trash through it. Chaplin continues walking and some trash falls upon him. For that, Chaplin insults the person and continues with his journey. He opens a silver cage where he stores a couple of cigars. Then, he grabs one and he lights it. He suddenly hears a cry and realizes that there is a baby on the floor. As he approaches the baby, a mum appears pushing a baby carriage. He grabs the baby and runs towards her to leave the infant inside it. Yet, the mum tells him that the baby is not hers and leaves with her real baby. Chaplin wonders whose baby is the one he has found, so he decides to leave the baby where he found it. In this moment, a police officer appears and a scared Chaplin takes the baby again and leaves the scene. In another street, Chaplin finds the opportunity of getting rid of the baby and, discreetly, he gives the baby to a man and runs away. The man pursues him and finds the baby carriage that appeared early on, so he decides to leave the baby there. The mum leaves the store where she was and finds the baby inside the carriage. In this moment, Chaplin appears on scene again and she runs towards him angrily to tell him to pick the baby. The police officer appears again and, in order to avoid reprisal, Chaplin grabs the baby and leaves again. Unsure about what to do, Charles sits on a kerb and  cares the baby. He finds a note wrapped with the blankets which says that this baby is an orphan and needs someone who cares for it. Finally, he decides to take the baby with him.		{'The': 4, 'video': 1, 'opens': 2, 'with': 5, 'the': 27, 'image': 1, 'of': 4, 'Charles': 2, 'Chaplin': 8, 'walking': 2, 'in': 3, 'street': 2, 'as': 1, 'he': 11, 'is': 5, 'smoking': 1, 'a': 13, 'cigar': 1, '.': 20, 'Then': 2, ',': 16, 'someone': 2, 'appears': 5, 'window': 1, 'and': 18, 'throws': 1, 'trash': 2, 'through': 1, 'it': 5, 'continues': 2, 'some': 1, 'falls': 1, 'upon': 1, 'him': 6, 'For': 1, 'that': 5, 'insults': 1, 'person': 1, 'his': 1, 'journey': 1, 'He': 4, 'silver': 1, 'cage': 1, 'where': 3, 'stores': 1, 'couple': 1, 'cigars': 1, 'grabs': 3, 'one': 2, 'lights': 1, 'suddenly': 1, 'hears': 1, 'cry': 1, 'realizes': 1, 'there': 2, 'baby': 19, 'on': 4, 'floor': 1, 'As': 1, 'approaches': 1, 'mum': 3, 'pushing': 1, 'carriage': 3, 'runs': 3, 'towards': 2, 'her': 2, 'to': 9, 'leave': 3, 'infant': 1, 'inside': 2, 'Yet': 1, 'tells': 1, 'not': 1, 'hers': 1, 'leaves': 4, 'real': 1, 'wonders': 1, 'whose': 1, 'has': 1, 'found': 2, 'so': 2, 'decides': 3, 'In': 3, 'this': 3, 'moment': 2, 'police': 2, 'officer': 2, 'scared': 1, 'takes': 1, 'again': 4, 'scene': 2, 'another': 1, 'finds': 4, 'opportunity': 1, 'getting': 1, 'rid': 1, 'discreetly': 1, 'gives': 1, 'man': 2, 'away': 1, 'pursues': 1, 'appeared': 1, 'early': 1, 'store': 1, 'she': 2, 'was': 1, 'angrily': 1, 'tell': 1, 'pick': 1, 'order': 1, 'avoid': 1, 'reprisal': 1, 'Unsure': 1, 'about': 1, 'what': 1, 'do': 1, 'sits': 1, 'kerb': 1, ' ': 1, 'cares': 2, 'note': 1, 'wrapped': 1, 'blankets': 1, 'which': 1, 'says': 1, 'an': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'needs': 1, 'who': 1, 'for': 1, 'Finally': 1, 'take': 1}	{'DET': 51, 'NOUN': 60, 'VERB': 61, 'ADP': 27, 'PROPN': 10, 'SCONJ': 9, 'PRON': 40, 'AUX': 8, 'PUNCT': 36, 'ADV': 17, 'CCONJ': 18, 'ADJ': 4, 'NUM': 1, 'PART': 9, 'SPACE': 1}

He starts smoking and some bricks are thrown at him. Therefore, the cigar he was smoking is useless now, so he takes a new one out of a box he's carrying. Just after he gets rid of his gloves, he notices an abandoned child laying on the pavement. He grabs the baby and spots a woman carrying a baby cart, which he follows right after. He places the baby inside, but after being told off by the woman, he takes the baby and walks away. He gives the baby to a passer-by, who is shocked. Then, he puts the baby in the trolley of the woman from before. The main character walks happily now, but the woman runs into him and starts hitting him because she thinks he has placed the baby in there.  In the middle of the argument, a police officer shows up wondering what the fight is all about. In order to avoid trouble, the man from the beginning keeps the baby. He seems not to know what to do next because he clearly does not want to keep it. He then realises there is a note inside the baby's clothing, remarking that it is a orphan child who needs to be looked after. His feelings change and now he happily walks away with the baby.

The main character of the scene finds an abandoned baby in what appears to be a dilapidated building. While questioning how the baby got there, the character finds a woman who is pushing a baby carriage. The man accuses the woman of abandoning the child –since he uses the verb “drop”– but the woman denies the accusation and refuses to take care of the baby. The main protagonist tries to find an alternative way to get rid of the baby, and tricks an unknown man. After a series of events (that unknown man leaves the baby in the woman’s baby carriage, the woman accuses Chaplin of trying to abandon the child, and a police office is closely keeping an eye on him), the character gives up and sits on the kerb. At the end of the scene, he realises there is a letter inside the child’s clothes, in which it is stated that the baby is an orphan. After reading the letter, Chaplin decides to take care of the baby.		{'This': 1, 'scene': 3, 'features': 1, 'Charles': 1, 'Chaplin': 3, ',': 9, 'a': 7, 'famous': 1, 'English': 1, 'comic': 1, 'actor': 1, 'and': 5, 'filmmaker': 1, '.': 8, 'The': 3, 'main': 2, 'character': 3, 'of': 8, 'the': 22, 'finds': 2, 'an': 5, 'abandoned': 1, 'baby': 9, 'in': 3, 'what': 1, 'appears': 1, 'to': 6, 'be': 1, 'dilapidated': 1, 'building': 1, 'While': 1, 'questioning': 1, 'how': 1, 'got': 1, 'there': 2, 'woman': 5, 'who': 1, 'is': 5, 'pushing': 1, 'carriage': 2, 'man': 3, 'accuses': 2, 'abandoning': 1, 'child': 3, '–': 2, 'since': 1, 'he': 2, 'uses': 1, 'verb': 1, '“': 1, 'drop': 1, '”': 1, 'but': 1, 'denies': 1, 'accusation': 1, 'refuses': 1, 'take': 2, 'care': 2, 'protagonist': 1, 'tries': 1, 'find': 1, 'alternative': 1, 'way': 1, 'get': 1, 'rid': 1, 'tricks': 1, 'unknown': 2, 'After': 2, 'series': 1, 'events': 1, '(': 1, 'that': 2, 'leaves': 1, '’s': 2, 'trying': 1, 'abandon': 1, 'police': 1, 'office': 1, 'closely': 1, 'keeping': 1, 'eye': 1, 'on': 2, 'him': 1, ')': 1, 'gives': 1, 'up': 1, 'sits': 1, 'kerb': 1, 'At': 1, 'end': 1, 'realises': 1, 'letter': 2, 'inside': 1, 'clothes': 1, 'which': 1, 'it': 1, 'stated': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'reading': 1, 'decides': 1}	{'DET': 39, 'NOUN': 49, 'VERB': 31, 'PROPN': 4, 'PUNCT': 23, 'ADJ': 9, 'CCONJ': 6, 'ADP': 18, 'PRON': 8, 'PART': 8, 'AUX': 6, 'SCONJ': 4, 'ADV': 2}

He stops to smoke and throws away his gloves. He then finds a baby on the street and he thinks that it fell from one of the buildings. He takes him. Then, a woman walks near them with a baby in a buggy and he looks at her. Chaplin goes towards her and, when she is not looking, he leaves the baby in her buggy. She comes back and gets very angry: she shouts at him and he leaves with the baby. He thus leaves the baby where he found it initially but, as he turns back, there is a policeman looking at him. He takes the baby again and leaves. After turning round the corner, he gives the baby to a man on the street, pretending that he is just going to tie his shoelaces. He runs away while the man with the baby follows him. The man then leaves the baby in the buggy in which Chaplin had tried to leave the baby before. While running away from the policeman, Chaplin passes near the buggy and the woman sees him and hits him with her umbrella. They argue and, as the policeman comes, he has to take the baby again. They sit on the pavement and he thinks about leaving the baby in the sewer, but he finds a note in the baby’s clothes that say “please love and care for this orphan child”. He smiles and happily takes the baby with him. <br/>  <br/> Nota: hice primero el ejercicio en español y puede haber influenciado mi forma de escribir ahora		{'Charles': 1, 'Chaplin': 4, 'wanders': 1, 'around': 1, 'the': 25, 'street': 3, 'among': 1, 'buildings': 2, 'under': 1, 'construction': 1, '.': 17, 'Some': 1, 'bricks': 1, 'fall': 1, 'over': 1, 'him': 8, 'twice': 1, 'He': 7, 'stops': 1, 'to': 5, 'smoke': 1, 'and': 13, 'throws': 1, 'away': 3, 'his': 2, 'gloves': 1, 'then': 2, 'finds': 2, 'a': 7, 'baby': 14, 'on': 3, 'he': 11, 'thinks': 2, 'that': 3, 'it': 2, 'fell': 1, 'from': 2, 'one': 1, 'of': 1, 'takes': 3, 'Then': 1, ',': 11, 'woman': 2, 'walks': 1, 'near': 2, 'them': 1, 'with': 5, 'in': 6, 'buggy': 4, 'looks': 1, 'at': 3, 'her': 4, 'goes': 1, 'towards': 1, 'when': 1, 'she': 2, 'is': 3, 'not': 1, 'looking': 2, 'leaves': 5, 'She': 1, 'comes': 2, 'back': 2, 'gets': 1, 'very': 1, 'angry': 1, ':': 2, 'shouts': 1, 'thus': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'initially': 1, 'but': 2, 'as': 2, 'turns': 1, 'there': 1, 'policeman': 3, 'again': 2, 'After': 1, 'turning': 1, 'round': 1, 'corner': 1, 'gives': 1, 'man': 3, 'pretending': 1, 'just': 1, 'going': 1, 'tie': 1, 'shoelaces': 1, 'runs': 1, 'while': 1, 'follows': 1, 'The': 1, 'which': 1, 'had': 1, 'tried': 1, 'leave': 1, 'before': 1, 'While': 1, 'running': 1, 'passes': 1, 'sees': 1, 'hits': 1, 'umbrella': 1, 'They': 2, 'argue': 1, 'has': 1, 'take': 1, 'sit': 1, 'pavement': 1, 'about': 1, 'leaving': 1, 'sewer': 1, 'note': 1, '’s': 1, 'clothes': 1, 'say': 1, '“': 1, 'please': 1, 'love': 1, 'care': 1, 'for': 1, 'this': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'child': 1, '”': 1, 'smiles': 1, 'happily': 1, '<': 2, 'br/': 2, '>': 2, ' ': 1, 'Nota': 1, 'hice': 1, 'primero': 1, 'el': 1, 'ejercicio': 1, 'en': 1, 'español': 1, 'y': 1, 'puede': 1, 'haber': 1, 'influenciado': 1, 'mi': 1, 'forma': 1, 'de': 1, 'escribir': 1, 'ahora': 1}	{'PROPN': 20, 'VERB': 51, 'ADP': 31, 'DET': 35, 'NOUN': 45, 'PUNCT': 32, 'PRON': 43, 'ADV': 18, 'PART': 6, 'CCONJ': 15, 'SCONJ': 8, 'NUM': 1, 'AUX': 3, 'ADJ': 2, 'INTJ': 1, 'X': 5, 'SPACE': 1}

He started smoking right there, since he became overwhelmed by the situation. <br/> Suddenly, he found an abandoned baby. He picked up the baby and tried to put him into a baby carriage which belonged to a lady. She realized and they had a quarrel. <br/> Chaplin tried to put him back where he was found, but a policeman thought he (a father) was trying to abandon his son, hence, he had to look for a different place for the child. After a little while, he found an old man who was unable to walk well due to his disability. Chaplin gave him the child and ran away. The old man could do nothing about it. However, he found the same baby carriage, so he put him into the carriage. The lady, who was shopping, thought that Chaplin was the real guilty guy who placed the baby inside, so they fought and she told the policeman what the situation was about. Therefore, Chaplin had to take care of the baby, since he was not able to throw the baby into the sewer that he found. Finally, he found out that the baby was carrying a note under his blanket. The baby was orphan.

Then he takes a cigarette out of a box and lights it with a match. After that, he finds a baby alone and picks him up. He sees a woman pushing a pram who seems to be looking for something, so he leaves the baby in the pram when the woman is not looking. She notices and tells him not to leave the baby there as it is not hers. He considers to leave it where he found it but a policeman appears, therefore he can't. He keeps on walking and sees another man, who is asked to hold the baby for a moment and then Chaplin runs away. This man carries the baby and sees the same woman with the pram and he leaves the baby in there again and walks away. When the woman notices, Chaplin passes her by chance and she blames him. The policeman appears again so Chaplin has to take the baby again. Finally, he sits on the pavement and, considering what to do with the baby, he finds a note asking to love and care the orphan child, so he decides to keep it.

Part of this waste falls on top of Chaplin putting out the cigarette he was smoking.   <br/> Chaplin takes out his cigar case from his jacket, where we can see several half-smoked cigars and cigarettes. After lighting up one of these cigarettes, he realizes that there is a baby wrapped in a blanket lying on the floor right next to the garbage.  <br/> Looking worried, Chaplin looks around for someone to give the baby to. He wants to give the baby to a woman that he sees on the street with a stroller but she refuses. He then, decides to leave the baby where he found it, but is spotted by a policeman and thus, has to take it back. After this, Chaplin, pretending to tie his shoe, hands the baby to a man who is walking down the street and runs off. This man in turn, leaves the baby again in the woman's stroller.  <br/> The woman, seeing the baby and Chaplin again complains to the police and Chaplin finds himself again with the baby in his arms. Sitting down on the pavement cuddling the baby, he finally finds a note asking to love and care for the orphan and Chaplin keeps the baby.

At first, he thinks someone might have dropped him by accident so he tries to return it to a woman passing by with her own baby, but she yells at him, probably because she believes he is trying to get rid of his baby. When Chaplin runs away from the angry mother, he puts the baby back when he found him; nevertheless, a policeman unexpectedly appears and he has to take the baby with him. However, he still tries to get rid of the poor creature by giving it to an old man and running away. The old man tries to chase him, but when he is unable to do so, he just tries to give the baby to someone else as well. He encounters the same mother Chaplin had already tried to give the baby to and runs away. When Chaplin passes by the woman and she realises the baby is there, she beats him up and screams at him violently. When the same policeman approaches to see what is happening, Chaplin just takes the baby again and goes away to avoid conflict.

In the note, the father or mother of the baby asks for whoever that encounters him, to please love and take care of him.

When he gets to an alley and lits a cigarette, he finds a child, very little and wrapped in a scarf, in the dirt pavement. Apparently by chance, a woman passes by with a baby trolley and the man, thinking the woman dropped the child unintentionally, places the baby in the carrier. The woman gets really mad that he has tried to place an unknown child with hers and forces him to take it back. After many unsuccessful attempts at getting rid of the baby, the man finds a handwritten letter pleading with whoever found it to care for the child. The man ultimately heeds this, and we are led to believe he does so.		{'We': 1, 'are': 2, 'introduced': 1, 'to': 6, 'a': 7, 'very': 2, 'awkward': 1, 'man': 4, ',': 9, 'who': 1, 'narrowly': 1, 'avoids': 1, 'being': 1, 'hit': 1, 'in': 4, 'the': 10, 'head': 1, 'with': 4, 'rubble': 1, 'several': 1, 'times': 1, '.': 6, 'When': 1, 'he': 4, 'gets': 2, 'an': 2, 'alley': 1, 'and': 5, 'lits': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'finds': 2, 'child': 4, 'little': 1, 'wrapped': 1, 'scarf': 1, 'dirt': 1, 'pavement': 1, 'Apparently': 1, 'by': 2, 'chance': 1, 'woman': 3, 'passes': 1, 'baby': 3, 'trolley': 1, 'thinking': 1, 'dropped': 1, 'unintentionally': 1, 'places': 1, 'carrier': 1, 'The': 2, 'really': 1, 'mad': 1, 'that': 1, 'has': 1, 'tried': 1, 'place': 1, 'unknown': 1, 'hers': 1, 'forces': 1, 'him': 1, 'take': 1, 'it': 2, 'back': 1, 'After': 1, 'many': 1, 'unsuccessful': 1, 'attempts': 1, 'at': 1, 'getting': 1, 'rid': 1, 'of': 1, 'handwritten': 1, 'letter': 1, 'pleading': 1, 'whoever': 1, 'found': 1, 'care': 1, 'for': 1, 'ultimately': 1, 'heeds': 1, 'this': 1, 'we': 1, 'led': 1, 'believe': 1, 'does': 1, 'so': 1}	{'PRON': 13, 'AUX': 5, 'VERB': 25, 'ADP': 17, 'DET': 21, 'ADV': 8, 'ADJ': 8, 'NOUN': 27, 'PUNCT': 15, 'SCONJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 5, 'PART': 4}

At first, he looks at the near buildings trying to find someone who could have forgot the child without success. Then, he picks him up and, thinking he might be the child of a lady that walks by at that precise moment, he tries to get the baby back to her. He puts the baby in the stroller, next to the other baby of the said lady, and she gets angry. She hits the man and apparently tells him the baby is not hers, so the man takes the baby back and tries to put him in the same spot where he founded him. This time, a policeman arrives and, thinking he may be abandoning that baby, gives the man a suspicious look. The man, alarmed, urgently picks up the baby again and takes him with him. <br/> Walking down the street, he tries to trick some other old man to pick up the baby and, without hesitating, he runs away. The old man, trying to find the man who tricked him, findsthe same lady that hit the man previously and leaves the baby in the stroller one more time and runs away. <br/> At the same time, the man who found the baby in the first place and then tricked someone to avoid keeping the baby, manages to run away safely. The only problem is that he meets the policeman again. To avoid suspicious situations one more time, he changes his path with so bad luck that he finds the lady that now is with an ""extra"" child. The lady bursts with anger and starts to hit the man so hard that he even ends up in the ground. The policeman arrives and the man has no choice rather than to pick the baby again. <br/> Devastated, he sits in the sidewalk with no more company than the baby. When he watches closely, he finds that the baby has a note in his clothes asking the one who finds the baby to give him love and care, for he is an orphan. The man, now motivated by the note, changes his face expression indicating that he may want to keep the child and perhaps raise him, and that he would give him the love and care the note asked for."

Everything is covered in dust and dirt and people are throwing their trash out of the window, and as it is to be expected, Charles gets bathed with one of these garbage rains. He looks up at the person in the window and screams some obscenities before taking a small box out of his blazer to get another cigarette since the one he was previously smoking fell off his mouth with the impact. Putting the box back in its original place and ungloving his hands, Charles takes a match out of his waistcoat pocket and lights it using the sole of his shoe and proceeds to start his cigarette, getting rid of his gloves and throwing them into a trash can near him right after. He's just dusted his hands and taken the first puff when he hears a noise. Looking down to his left he sees a baby wrapped in some thin sheets and blankets lying on the ground. Charles bents down and checks under covers to make sure it is in a baby and then looks around confusedly, trying to find someone, probably someone who could be this kid's parent. Seeing, there's no one, he picks it up, and that's when a woman with a stroller passes by. Charles calls her up but the woman doesn't hear him, so he walks after her. However, when he catches up and gets to the stroller, the woman is nowhere to be seen, so he does what he considers logical and puts the baby in it, next to the woman's kid. The woman reappears seconds after and Charles tells her ""she's dropped something"" and attempts to leave, but the woman won't let him. Gesticulating and making her anger very visible, she gets Charles to take the baby back into his arms, but not before he mistakenly tries to pick up the wrong kid, which only makes the woman more agitated. After the encounter both people go their separate ways, Charles going back to the corner where he found the baby with the intention of leaving him there, never realising he's being watched by a police officer that's standing right behind him. The baby barely gets the chance to touch the ground because, as soon as Charles turns around and sees the expression of the imposing officer, he quickly changes his mind and picks the baby back up, walking away from the officer immediately. Once he's far enough, Charles tries his luck again. Seeing an old man, he stops him and gets him to hold the baby with the excuse of needing to tied his shoes. Charles kneels down just long enough for the old man to believe the lie before he sets off running to go and hide. The old man goes in his search, but not being able to find him, decides to do what Charles had done earlier and puts the baby in the woman's stroller that is now next to a shoe store and runs away. The woman shows up a moment later and is looking at the two babies incredulously when she sees Charles, who's has left his hiding place, walk past her without a care. She runs after him and attacks him from behind with her big umbrella, tackling him down to the ground where she keeps hitting him. This diverts into a heated discussion that only finishes when the police officer reappears and both the woman and Charles leave with their respective babies. Charles then sits on the pavement, with the baby still in his arms, contemplating what to do next. A manhole cover next to him catches then his attention.  He lifts it up, briefly considering whether he could do what he's thinking of doing, but then disregards the idea within a second. It's then, looking at the baby, that he realises there's a note stuck to its clothes, a note which reads ""Please, love and care for this orphan kid"". Charles doesn't have the heart to get rid of the kid after that. He looks down at the kid and smiles. Taking the walking stick he had laid next to him on the pavement, he gets up and leaves, holding the baby protectively against his chest."

Chaplin	written_online	30.0	Outside classroom		The video starts with Chaplin walking through a sloppy street, where rubbish is thrown at him from a window, after he cleans himself and fire a new cigarette Chaplin notices a baby next to a rubbish bin. In the moment he takes the baby from the floor he sees a lady with a buggy behind him, so he thinks that the lady might have lost the baby. He walks towards the buggy and place the baby inside while the woman is inside the building. When the woman leaves the building she reacts like that baby is not her kid and she asks (or probably imposes) Chaplin to pick the kid and leave, at first Chaplin attempts to take the other baby but she indicates that the baby he was trying to take wasnt the one he had put in the buggy before, then he picks up the right baby. Chaplin walks away with the baby and tries to leave the baby where he found it, next to the rubbish, but a police officer appears and Chaplin takes the baby back. In the next scene, Chaplin asks another gentleman to hold the baby while he pretends to tie his shoes, when Chaplin has the chance he runs away and hide. The gentleman tries to follow him but he can't find Chaplin, however he finds the lady's buggy and place the baby in it, one more time. When the woman sees the baby again she starts looking across the street and when she sees Chaplin she hits him with her umbrella, they start arguing because none of them want to take the baby, the police officer appears again and Chaplin, scared of the officer, take the baby and goes away. In the last scene, Chaplin seats on the edge of the pavement, next to a drain, Chaplin opens the drain, with the idea of throwing the baby inside it, but he doesn't do it. Finally, Chaplin finds a note inside the baby's clothes saying that the baby is an orphan and asking to the person who finds the note to take care and love the child.

Chaplin	written_online	600.0	Outside classroom	Monolingual dictionary	At the beginning of the video, we can se Charles Chaplin in the background walking towards the foreground. While he is walking and smoking, somebody is throwing debris to the street from a window.  <br/> He keeps walking. Then, near some rubbish bins, some rubbish falls on him from above. He looks up to see who did that and retrieves a metal box from his jacket pocket. Inside, cigars and cigarettes can be found. He takes a cigarette and removes his gloves; after that, he lights a match in his right sole to light his cigarette. Then, he throws his gloves away and looks to his left. There, next to the rubbish bins, a baby, wrapped in blankets, lies on the floor.  <br/> He touches the baby carefully and looks around as if trying to find whose baby this is. Since he finds nobody, he holds the baby. While he is trying to find its parents, a woman pulling a baby stroller appears in the background. He calls her and runs towards her. And, immediately after reaching her, he places the baby in the stroller, where there is already another baby. The woman, surprised, starts yelling at him and tells him to hold the baby again, as it is assumed it is not hers. He obeys, but almost takes the wrong baby. Finally, he retrieves the right baby from the stroller and runs away from the woman.  <br/> He goes back to the corner where he found the baby and puts it in the same place. A police officer appears. He blows a kiss to the baby but after seeing the police officer he takes the baby again.  <br/> He starts walking and sees another man, with a cane, on his way. He asks him to hold the baby while he cleans his shoes as he stepped into a muddy puddle. Once the stranger is holding the baby, Chaplin runs away. The stranger follows him as fast as he can, but Chaplin finds a place with a door open and hides there. In his search, the stranger finds the abovementioned stroller and, since nobody is watching it, he puts the baby inside and runs. When Chaplin leaves his secret place he finds the police officer on his way so he starts walking fast in the opposite direction. Then, the previous woman returns to her stroller and finds two babies instead of one. So, when Chaplin passes by them, she calls him in the middle of the street. However, he pretends not to have heard anything and keeps walking. So she starts running after him and hits his head with her umbrella until he is lying on the floor. She grabs him and takes him with her until they both reach the stroller. Then, she warns him to take the baby. In fact, as the police officers passes by, she calls him to inform about their situation. Finally, Chaplin takes the baby again and everybody resumes their way.  <br/> After a few steps, Chaplin drops his cane by a sewer. So he sits down to retrieve it and lifts the top of the sewer thinking about putting the baby there. Nevertheless, he thinks twice and rejects this idea. While he is figuring out how to hold the baby and his cane at the same time, he finds a letter between the baby's blankets indicating to love and care for that orphan child. After reading it, Chaplin feels sorry for the baby, keeps the letter in his inner pocket and smiles at the baby. He stands up and eventually takes the baby with him.

He is thrown trash from above him, and after that he opens up a small metal box containing cigars, he takes one and lights it to smoke it. Next to where he is standing, he finds a baby and assumes he/she is the child of a lady who's walking in the alley as well, pushing a baby stroller with another baby in it. The main character approaches her and gives her the baby, but the child is not hers so the protagonist leaves the baby where he found it. Just as he is doing that, a police officer shows up and gives him a judgemental look, making the protagonist take the baby again. He then finds an old man and gives the baby to him before running away. This old man leaves the baby in the stroller of the lady when she is not looking and runs away. While he does that, Chaplin's character encounters the police officer again and runs away from him. He is caught by the woman, who assumes he was the one to put the baby in the stroller and she follows him to beat him. The same police officer appears again and the woman explains the situation to him, which leaves no choice for the protagonist other than to take the baby. He is desperate and even considers putting the baby in a sewer, but finds a note attached to him/her that says: ""Please love and care for this orphan child"".

Someone, probably some workers, is throwing rubble from the window of a building, which almost hits the man. He keeps walking, until another worker throws more rubble through another window; this time, the protagonist gets hit. He gets angry and insults the worker; he also realises he has lost his cigarette, so he picks another one from a metal case and lights it. He intends to keep walking, when he notices a little baby lying on the floor, wrapped up in a blanket and crying. The man looks around to see if the baby has fallen from a window, and he picks him up. Suddenly, he sees a woman pushing a baby buggy, with another kid in it. The man comes closer and leaves the baby inside the buggy, but the woman yells at him and tells him to take the baby out of the buggy.  <br/>  <br/> The man picks the baby and he intends to leave the kid where he was lying, but a policeman shows up, so the man has to pick him up again. He walks with the baby in his arms until he sees an old man walking down the street. He asks him to hold the baby with the excuse of tying up his shoelaces, but once he leaves the baby in the old man's arms, he runs away. The old man doesn't know what to do, but he sees a baby buggy on the street, so he leaves the baby in it. The same woman that appeared before comes out of a shop, and she gets very angry when she sees the baby in the buggy again. Suddenly, the protagonist of the video shows up, so she thinks he has left the baby there and runs after him to beat him with her umbrella. She forces him to take the baby, and when the policeman shows up again, she asks him for help, so the protagonist has to pick the baby up. <br/>  <br/> The man walks away from the street with the baby in his arms, until he sits on the pavement. He doesn't know what to do. He sees a drain next to the pavement; he opens it and looks at the baby, but he nods and closes the drain. He looks at the baby again, and he feels something in the blanket. He takes out a piece of paper, where he reads: ""please love and care of this orphan child"". The protagonist feels moved by the letter; now his feelings towards the baby have changed. He stands up and walks away, taking the baby with him."

However, there was a baby in that woman's chair so he decided to put the baby back where he found it, but a policeman appeared suddenly so he took the baby again and gave it to a man before running away.

As he walks past the buildings, some of the people inside throw rubbish out the windows, hitting the tramp. When he reaches the foreground, and after cursing the last person who's thrown his or her rubbish on him, he searches for his cigarette box in his jacket pockets. There are only butts in his box, but he lights one and smokes. He removes his mittens in the process to do it more easily, but then decides to just throw them away instead of putting them back on or in his pocket. <br/>  <br/> At that precise moment he hears a baby crying next to him, and finds him on the ground, wrapped in some blankets, by a rubbish can. The tramp looks up, thinking that maybe someone has thrown the baby away through the window with the trash. He lifts the infant. Behind him a lady passes with a pushchair. The tramp sees her and walks up to her to give her the child--""Excuse me, you've dropped something""--says the tramp to her. If he is either innocently trying to return the baby to his mother, or cunningly trying to get rid of the child, we are not told; his attitude is ambiguous. The tramp then tries to leave the baby in the pushchair. The lady, outraged by what she perceives as the tramp's knavery,  rebukes him severely and forces him to take the baby back with him. <br/>  <br/> When Charlot is about to leave the child back where he found him, a policeman catches him red-handed, so he sees himself in the obligation to take the baby with him again. After that, he comes across a bearded hobo, and pretends he has to do his shoelace to ask him to hold the baby for a second, taking advantage of this to escape without the baby. He runs off and hides; the bearded vagabond looks for him, but, unable to find Charlot, he tries to leave the baby in a pushchair he sees at the door of a shoe-shop. He walks off. Charlot gets out of his hideout, but stumbles upon the police officer, which makes him turn around and take the opposite direction. The lady he encountered before steps out of the shop where the pushchair was, and just at that moment he passes by. This coincidence makes the lady think it is him again who has tried to sneak another baby in her pushchair. This time the furious lady beats the tramp violently with her umbrella. The policeman arrives while they are quarreling, and in consequence the tramp has no choice but to take the baby again with him. <br/>  <br/> As he wanders along the sidewalk with the child in his arms, the tramp drops his cane stick. He sits on the curb, picks up his stick and suddenly notices the gutter. He considers for a dramatic moment to throw the baby down the gutter, but discards the brutish option. He begins examining the child, who bits his finger. Thus, he finds a piece of paper among the baby's clothes, with a message written on it: ""Please love and care for this orphan child"".

After that he takes a cigarette and he starts smoking. He finds a baby who is crying and he starts looking in every direction to see if he finds someone. He sees a woman with another baby and he thinks the baby is hers and he tells her: 'Pardon me, you dropped something.' The woman seems to be saying the baby is not hers and he takes the baby back again and when he is going to put him/her where he found her/him a police man sees him abandoning the baby so he picks the baby up again. He gives the baby to a man in the street while he pretends to tie his shoelaces and then he run away. The man follows him and when he does not find him the man decides to put the baby in the stroller again. The woman comes back to the stroller and she finds a second baby again but in that moment Chapling is walking next to her so she starts hitting him with an umbrella. The polices man appears again and the woman seems to be telling him that Chaplin was abandoning the baby so he takes it back. Chaplin finds a note which says to take care of the orphan baby.

Chaplin	written_online	10.0	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (Spanish/English)	In this black-and-white video, it can be seen Charles Chaplin in one of his silent films. In the first scene of the video, Chaplin is in the middle of an alley, where people are throwing away what seems to be rubble and dirt until one person throws rubbish upon him. In a close-up image of Chaplin, we can see he is wearing mittens and grab a cigarette just before seeing a baby abandoned in the middle of the alley. As he does not know what to do with this child, he tries to get rid of him in different ways. First, he tries to get the baby in a lady’s baby pushchair, with another baby in it. He is caught, so he tries to leave the baby in the same place he found it, being caught again by a police officer. In his third attempt, he manages to do get rid of the baby, leaving him with a bearded man. However, eventually, the baby ends up again in the lady’s pushchair and as she recognises Chaplin, she told him off and calls the same police officer that was patrolling there. Finally, Chaplin, just when he is about to leave the kid in the sewage system, finds a note, in which someone wrote that this kid is an orphan and requests that whoever has found him to take care of him. This final letter seems to be the conclusive reason for Chaplin to adopt the child.		{'In': 4, 'this': 3, 'black': 1, '-': 3, 'and': 6, 'white': 1, 'video': 2, ',': 18, 'it': 3, 'can': 2, 'be': 3, 'seen': 1, 'Charles': 1, 'Chaplin': 6, 'in': 10, 'one': 2, 'of': 8, 'his': 2, 'silent': 1, 'films': 1, '.': 10, 'the': 16, 'first': 1, 'scene': 1, 'is': 5, 'middle': 2, 'an': 2, 'alley': 2, 'where': 1, 'people': 1, 'are': 1, 'throwing': 1, 'away': 1, 'what': 2, 'seems': 2, 'to': 10, 'rubble': 1, 'dirt': 1, 'until': 1, 'person': 1, 'throws': 1, 'rubbish': 1, 'upon': 1, 'him': 6, 'a': 7, 'close': 1, 'up': 2, 'image': 1, 'we': 1, 'see': 1, 'he': 8, 'wearing': 1, 'mittens': 1, 'grab': 1, 'cigarette': 1, 'just': 2, 'before': 1, 'seeing': 1, 'baby': 7, 'abandoned': 1, 'As': 1, 'does': 1, 'not': 1, 'know': 1, 'do': 2, 'with': 3, 'child': 2, 'tries': 3, 'get': 3, 'rid': 2, 'different': 1, 'ways': 1, 'First': 1, 'lady': 2, '’s': 2, 'pushchair': 2, 'another': 1, 'He': 1, 'caught': 2, 'so': 1, 'leave': 2, 'same': 2, 'place': 1, 'found': 2, 'being': 1, 'again': 2, 'by': 1, 'police': 2, 'officer': 2, 'third': 1, 'attempt': 1, 'manages': 1, 'leaving': 1, 'bearded': 1, 'man': 1, 'However': 1, 'eventually': 1, 'ends': 1, 'as': 1, 'she': 2, 'recognises': 1, 'told': 1, 'off': 1, 'calls': 1, 'that': 3, 'was': 1, 'patrolling': 1, 'there': 1, 'Finally': 1, 'when': 1, 'about': 1, 'kid': 2, 'sewage': 1, 'system': 1, 'finds': 1, 'note': 1, 'which': 1, 'someone': 1, 'wrote': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'requests': 1, 'whoever': 1, 'has': 1, 'take': 1, 'care': 1, 'This': 1, 'final': 1, 'letter': 1, 'conclusive': 1, 'reason': 1, 'for': 1, 'adopt': 1}	{'ADP': 30, 'DET': 30, 'ADJ': 15, 'PUNCT': 31, 'CCONJ': 6, 'NOUN': 45, 'PRON': 29, 'AUX': 17, 'VERB': 36, 'PROPN': 7, 'NUM': 2, 'SCONJ': 9, 'ADV': 11, 'PART': 13}

He stops, brushes off the dust and takes out a cigarrette tin. The tramp takes off his  worn off gloves, of which most fingers are missing, and carefully selects a cigarrette stub from an assortment of cigarrette and cigar ends, lights it striking a match on his sole. He throws away the match into a bin and then throws the gloves too. After walkin on a few steps, he finds a little  baby lying on the floor, picks it up and looks up as if the baby could have fallen off a window. The tramp turns around and sees a woman pushing a big perambulator carrying one baby, he imagines she dropped the baby he found and puts it inside the perambulator but the woman complains, so he takes the baby again and puts it carefully where he found it but as he's about to leave the baby a policeman arrives so The tramp turns immediately, picks up the baby again and goes away. <br/> While The tramp is carrying the baby, he walks by a passer-by, pretends to have to tie his shoelace and ask the unknown to hold the baby but as soon as the passer-by has the baby in his hands, the tramp runs away. The unknown sees a perambulator outside a shop, puts the baby inside and leaves. As The tramp is walking by, the mother and owner of the perambulator comes out of the shop, discovers the second baby and guesses the Tramp has done it again. She chases him and hits him with her umbrella back to the perambulator. When they are discussing about the baby the same cop arrives again and The tramp takes the baby and leaves. He sits on the curb and considers throwing the baby into the sewer but on second thoughts he doesn't and pets it. Something pricks his finger and he finds a note saying please love and care this orphan child. He decides to do it.

Chaplin	written_online	30.0	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (Spanish/English)	From afar comes a man, actually, he is Charles Chaplin, he wears a scruffy suit, a hat and big shoes. This bizarre outfit gives him a funny air. He has a cigarette between his lips and when he blows the smoke comes as if he was a steam locomotive. He walks like nothing around him matters, like he is oblivious of his surrounding. He passes below an open window, from which a man appears and throw something white, perhaps dust or flour, who knows. Mr. Chaplin looks at the fallen thing just for a second and continues with his walk in that clumsy way he has. He approaches and gets closer and closer. And while he walks, he changes the cane he is holding from one hand to another and plays with it and bends it. Suddenly, something from above falls on his head and this time it really bothers him. He looks up and down trying to find from where that thing comes. Then, from his pocket he gets a tin, a tobacco tin, he opens it and take one cigarette. Then, he takes the tin back to his pocket and after removing his gloves he lights the cigarette and starts smoking again. He gets rid of the gloves by throwing them into a bin and when he looks at his right he finds a baby crying wrapped up in a blanket. He looks everywhere trying to find his parents. “Where this baby comes from?”, he seems to wonder. He takes the baby in his arms and in the distance he sees a woman pushing a baby buggy. Thinking that perhaps she is the baby’s mother, Mr. Chaplin puts the baby inside the buggy. When the women finds out, she starts yelling at him and he can do nothing but to take the baby away and retrieve the poor thing to his or her original place. However, a policeman just appears from nowhere and looks at him in an earnest way that makes Mr. Chaplin take the baby again in a rush and leave. Afterwards, he finds an old man walking in a cane; he gives the baby to him and flees. The old man goes after him but Mr. Chaplin hides away. In his way, trying to find Mr. Chaplin, the old man just by chance finds the baby baggy mentioned above and leaves the baby inside it and runs away. When the woman finds out that there was an “intruder”, she gets really crossed. The funny thing is that Mr. Chaplin walks in front of her own eyes, so the women goes after him shouting and raising her umbrella and pointing it at him. She starts striking him repeatedly, shouting at him and demanding an explanation. The policeman appears and approaches since these two are enrolled in an argument, the woman explains what has just happened and Mr. Chaplin just takes the baby away once again. He seats down and next to him finds a gutter and opens it. For just a moment, he weights his possibilities. However, something happens: the baby carries a note which reads “Please, love and care for this orphan child”. Mr. Chaplin looks at the baby with compassion and kindness, takes him in his arms and without raising his eyes from him, leaves the scene.		{'From': 1, 'afar': 1, 'comes': 4, 'a': 21, 'man': 5, ',': 30, 'actually': 1, 'he': 21, 'is': 5, 'Charles': 1, 'Chaplin': 9, 'wears': 1, 'scruffy': 1, 'suit': 1, 'hat': 1, 'and': 32, 'big': 1, 'shoes': 1, '.': 30, 'This': 1, 'bizarre': 1, 'outfit': 1, 'gives': 2, 'him': 14, 'funny': 2, 'air': 1, 'He': 9, 'has': 3, 'cigarette': 3, 'between': 1, 'his': 15, 'lips': 1, 'when': 2, 'blows': 1, 'the': 26, 'smoke': 1, 'as': 1, 'if': 1, 'was': 2, 'steam': 1, 'locomotive': 1, 'walks': 3, 'like': 2, 'nothing': 2, 'around': 1, 'matters': 1, 'oblivious': 1, 'of': 3, 'surrounding': 1, 'passes': 1, 'below': 1, 'an': 6, 'open': 1, 'window': 1, 'from': 8, 'which': 2, 'appears': 3, 'throw': 1, 'something': 3, 'white': 1, 'perhaps': 2, 'dust': 1, 'or': 2, 'flour': 1, 'who': 1, 'knows': 1, 'Mr.': 8, 'looks': 6, 'at': 7, 'fallen': 1, 'thing': 4, 'just': 6, 'for': 2, 'second': 1, 'continues': 1, 'with': 3, 'walk': 1, 'in': 10, 'that': 6, 'clumsy': 1, 'way': 3, 'approaches': 2, 'gets': 4, 'closer': 2, 'And': 1, 'while': 1, 'changes': 1, 'cane': 2, 'holding': 1, 'one': 2, 'hand': 1, 'to': 10, 'another': 1, 'plays': 1, 'it': 7, 'bends': 1, 'Suddenly': 1, 'above': 2, 'falls': 1, 'on': 1, 'head': 1, 'this': 3, 'time': 1, 'really': 2, 'bothers': 1, 'up': 2, 'down': 2, 'trying': 3, 'find': 3, 'where': 1, 'Then': 2, 'pocket': 2, 'tin': 3, 'tobacco': 1, 'opens': 2, 'take': 3, 'takes': 4, 'back': 1, 'after': 3, 'removing': 1, 'gloves': 2, 'lights': 1, 'starts': 3, 'smoking': 1, 'again': 3, 'rid': 1, 'by': 2, 'throwing': 1, 'them': 1, 'into': 1, 'bin': 1, 'right': 1, 'finds': 6, 'baby': 14, 'crying': 1, 'wrapped': 1, 'blanket': 1, 'everywhere': 1, 'parents': 1, '“': 3, 'Where': 1, '?': 1, '”': 3, 'seems': 1, 'wonder': 1, 'arms': 2, 'distance': 1, 'sees': 1, 'woman': 3, 'pushing': 1, 'buggy': 2, 'Thinking': 1, 'she': 3, '’s': 1, 'mother': 1, 'puts': 1, 'inside': 2, 'When': 2, 'women': 2, 'out': 2, 'yelling': 1, 'can': 1, 'do': 1, 'but': 2, 'away': 4, 'retrieve': 1, 'poor': 1, 'her': 3, 'original': 1, 'place': 1, 'However': 2, 'policeman': 2, 'nowhere': 1, 'earnest': 1, 'makes': 1, 'rush': 1, 'leave': 1, 'Afterwards': 1, 'old': 3, 'walking': 1, ';': 1, 'flees': 1, 'The': 3, 'goes': 2, 'hides': 1, 'In': 1, 'chance': 1, 'baggy': 1, 'mentioned': 1, 'leaves': 2, 'runs': 1, 'there': 1, 'intruder': 1, 'crossed': 1, 'front': 1, 'own': 1, 'eyes': 2, 'so': 1, 'shouting': 2, 'raising': 2, 'umbrella': 1, 'pointing': 1, 'She': 1, 'striking': 1, 'repeatedly': 1, 'demanding': 1, 'explanation': 1, 'since': 1, 'these': 1, 'two': 1, 'are': 1, 'enrolled': 1, 'argument': 1, 'explains': 1, 'what': 1, 'happened': 1, 'once': 1, 'seats': 1, 'next': 1, 'gutter': 1, 'For': 1, 'moment': 1, 'weights': 1, 'possibilities': 1, 'happens': 1, ':': 1, 'carries': 1, 'note': 1, 'reads': 1, 'Please': 1, 'love': 1, 'care': 1, 'orphan': 1, 'child': 1, 'compassion': 1, 'kindness': 1, 'without': 1, 'scene': 1}	{'ADP': 59, 'ADV': 34, 'VERB': 105, 'DET': 63, 'NOUN': 96, 'PUNCT': 69, 'PRON': 86, 'AUX': 9, 'PROPN': 19, 'ADJ': 21, 'CCONJ': 36, 'SCONJ': 16, 'NUM': 3, 'PART': 6, 'INTJ': 1}

Chaplin	written_online	3.0	Outside classroom		At first, we see Chaplin walking through the city until he stops to smoke a cigarette. He, then, founds a baby wrapped in a blanket but because he is unable to find the baby's parents, he tries putting it back where he found it. At the same time, a policeman appears and obviously thinks it is Chaplin who is abandoning the baby so he is forced to take it with him. He tricks a random man into holding the baby and then takes off. However, after turning a corner, he founds himself accused of abandoning the baby by a woman and ends up with the baby in his arms again. After all, it seems like Chaplin is destined to care for the baby and takes it with him. 		"{'At': 2, 'first': 1, ',': 8, 'we': 1, 'see': 1, 'Chaplin': 3, 'walking': 1, 'through': 1, 'the': 8, 'city': 1, 'until': 1, 'he': 6, 'stops': 1, 'to': 4, 'smoke': 1, 'a': 7, 'cigarette': 1, '.': 6, 'He': 2, 'then': 2, 'founds': 2, 'baby': 7, 'wrapped': 1, 'in': 2, 'blanket': 1, 'but': 1, 'because': 1, 'is': 5, 'unable': 1, 'find': 1, ""'s"": 1, 'parents': 1, 'tries': 1, 'putting': 1, 'it': 6, 'back': 1, 'where': 1, 'found': 1, 'same': 1, 'time': 1, 'policeman': 1, 'appears': 1, 'and': 4, 'obviously': 1, 'thinks': 1, 'who': 1, 'abandoning': 2, 'so': 1, 'forced': 1, 'take': 1, 'with': 3, 'him': 2, 'tricks': 1, 'random': 1, 'man': 1, 'into': 1, 'holding': 1, 'takes': 2, 'off': 1, 'However': 1, 'after': 1, 'turning': 1, 'corner': 1, 'himself': 1, 'accused': 1, 'of': 1, 'by': 1, 'woman': 1, 'ends': 1, 'up': 1, 'his': 1, 'arms': 1, 'again': 1, 'After': 1, 'all': 1, 'seems': 1, 'like': 1, 'destined': 1, 'care': 1, 'for': 1, '\xa0': 1}"	{'ADP': 15, 'ADV': 9, 'PUNCT': 14, 'PRON': 20, 'VERB': 27, 'PROPN': 3, 'DET': 15, 'NOUN': 17, 'SCONJ': 5, 'PART': 5, 'CCONJ': 5, 'AUX': 5, 'ADJ': 3, 'SPACE': 1}
