A few seconds later after smoking a cigarette, he discovers a child lying on the floor. He picks it up and searches for the mother. Afterwards, a mother with a child passes by. Chaplin thinks, that she might be the mother of the child. But that is not the case, because she denies being the mother. This leads to Chaplin laying the child back down where he found it, until a police officer appears. Without wanting to leave a bad impression, he picks up the child again and runs away, until he gives it to a homeless person on the way. The homeless person lays the child in a baby buggy, which belongs to the mother from a few moments ago. Of course there is no other than Charlie Chaplin who appears afterwards, which leads to the mother beating him up. The policeman appears afterwards as well, so Chaplin has to leave again with the baby. Sitting on the street with the kid, Chaplin discovers a letter and gets to know that the child has been abandoned by its parents. Finally, one can see Chaplin smiling towards the orphan holding it.",,"{"","":13,""."":13,""A"":1,""Afterwards"":1,""But"":1,""Chaplin"":7,""Charlie"":2,""Finally"":1,""He"":1,""In"":1,""Of"":1,""Sitting"":1,""The"":2,""This"":1,""Without"":1,""a"":11,""abandoned"":1,""after"":1,""afterwards"":2,""again"":2,""ago"":1,""and"":3,""appears"":3,""as"":1,""away"":1,""baby"":2,""back"":1,""bad"":1,""be"":1,""beating"":1,""because"":1,""been"":1,""being"":1,""belongs"":1,""buggy"":1,""by"":2,""can"":2,""case"":1,""child"":7,""cigarette"":1,""clip"":1,""course"":1,""denies"":1,""discovers"":2,""down"":1,""few"":2,""floor"":1,""following"":1,""for"":1,""found"":1,""from"":1,""gets"":1,""gives"":1,""going"":1,""has"":2,""he"":4,""him"":1,""holding"":1,""homeless"":2,""impression"":1,""in"":1,""is"":2,""it"":4,""its"":1,""kid"":1,""know"":1,""later"":1,""laying"":1,""lays"":1,""leads"":2,""leave"":2,""letter"":1,""lying"":1,""might"":1,""moments"":1,""mother"":6,""no"":1,""not"":1,""of"":1,""officer"":1,""on"":3,""one"":2,""orphan"":1,""other"":1,""parents"":1,""passes"":1,""person"":2,""picks"":2,""police"":1,""policeman"":1,""runs"":1,""searches"":1,""seconds"":1,""see"":2,""she"":2,""smiling"":1,""smoking"":1,""so"":1,""street"":2,""than"":1,""that"":3,""the"":18,""there"":1,""thinks"":1,""through"":1,""to"":7,""towards"":1,""until"":2,""up"":3,""wanting"":1,""way"":1,""well"":1,""where"":1,""which"":2,""who"":1,""with"":3}","{""ADJ"":8,""ADP"":25,""ADV"":16,""AUX"":8,""CCONJ"":4,""DET"":33,""NOUN"":34,""PART"":4,""PRON"":21,""PROPN"":9,""PUNCT"":26,""SCONJ"":6,""VERB"":36}","In,ADP,the,DET,following,ADJ,clip,NOUN,,,PUNCT,one,PRON,can,AUX,see,VERB,Charlie,PROPN,Chaplin,PROPN,going,VERB,through,ADP,a,DET,street,NOUN,.,PUNCT,A,DET,few,ADJ,seconds,NOUN,later,ADV,after,ADP,smoking,VERB,a,DET,cigarette,NOUN,,,PUNCT,he,PRON,discovers,VERB,a,DET,child,NOUN,lying,VERB,on,ADP,the,DET,floor,NOUN,.,PUNCT,He,PRON,picks,VERB,it,PRON,up,ADP,and,CCONJ,searches,VERB,for,ADP,the,DET,mother,NOUN,.,PUNCT,Afterwards,ADV,,,PUNCT,a,DET,mother,NOUN,with,ADP,a,DET,child,NOUN,passes,VERB,by,ADP,.,PUNCT,Chaplin,PROPN,thinks,VERB,,,PUNCT,that,SCONJ,she,PRON,might,AUX,be,AUX,the,DET,mother,NOUN,of,ADP,the,DET,child,NOUN,.,PUNCT,But,CCONJ,that,PRON,is,AUX,not,PART,the,DET,case,NOUN,,,PUNCT,because,SCONJ,she,PRON,denies,VERB,being,AUX,the,DET,mother,NOUN,.,PUNCT,This,PRON,leads,VERB,to,ADP,Chaplin,PROPN,laying,VERB,the,DET,child,NOUN,back,ADV,down,ADV,where,SCONJ,he,PRON,found,VERB,it,PRON,,,PUNCT,until,SCONJ,a,DET,police,NOUN,officer,NOUN,appears,VERB,.,PUNCT,Without,ADP,wanting,VERB,to,PART,leave,VERB,a,DET,bad,ADJ,impression,NOUN,,,PUNCT,he,PRON,picks,VERB,up,ADP,the,DET,child,NOUN,again,ADV,and,CCONJ,runs,VERB,away,ADV,,,PUNCT,until,SCONJ,he,PRON,gives,VERB,it,PRON,to,ADP,a,DET,homeless,ADJ,person,NOUN,on,ADP,the,DET,way,NOUN,.,PUNCT,The,DET,homeless,ADJ,person,NOUN,lays,VERB,the,DET,child,NOUN,in,ADP,a,DET,baby,NOUN,buggy,ADJ,,,PUNCT,which,PRON,belongs,VERB,to,ADP,the,DET,mother,NOUN,from,ADP,a,DET,few,ADJ,moments,NOUN,ago,ADV,.,PUNCT,Of,ADV,course,ADV,there,PRON,is,VERB,no,DET,other,ADJ,than,ADP,Charlie,PROPN,Chaplin,PROPN,who,PRON,appears,VERB,afterwards,ADV,,,PUNCT,which,PRON,leads,VERB,to,ADP,the,DET,mother,NOUN,beating,VERB,him,PRON,up,ADP,.,PUNCT,The,DET,policeman,NOUN,appears,VERB,afterwards,ADV,as,ADV,well,ADV,,,PUNCT,so,ADV,Chaplin,PROPN,has,VERB,to,PART,leave,VERB,again,ADV,with,ADP,the,DET,baby,NOUN,.,PUNCT,Sitting,VERB,on,ADP,the,DET,street,NOUN,with,ADP,the,DET,kid,NOUN,,,PUNCT,Chaplin,PROPN,discovers,VERB,a,DET,letter,NOUN,and,CCONJ,gets,VERB,to,PART,know,VERB,that,SCONJ,the,DET,child,NOUN,has,AUX,been,AUX,abandoned,VERB,by,ADP,its,PRON,parents,NOUN,.,PUNCT,Finally,ADV,,,PUNCT,one,PRON,can,AUX,see,VERB,Chaplin,PROPN,smiling,VERB,towards,ADP,the,DET,orphan,NOUN,holding,VERB,it,PRON,.,PUNCT"

In the first sequence one can see Charlie Chaplin lighting a cigarette. By doing so he suddenly notices a baby besides the bins on the ground. He is not able to identify the parents of the baby. As he sees a woman passing by with a stroller, he suggests that it could be the mother of the baby. So he layed the baby in to the stroller. It turned out that it was not her baby. As a consequence she started mocking at Charlie, so he had to take it out of the stroller again. As he had no other idea where to place down the baby, he layed it back to the place he found the baby. But this move failed again. A officer cought him laying down the baby on the floor so he had to pick up the baby again. Once more he is disperately thinking of an other option. He encounters an old man, which he could hand over the baby with a ruse and flees right afterwards. This olderly man then sees the woman with the stroller, and puts it in the stroller as Charlie had done before. Therfore the woman suggested Charlie the one ho had put the baby in her stroller as Charlie crossed her way. She hits him with a umbrella and gives him back the baby. Charlie gives up and now realises that it is  an orphan baby as he finds a small letter which says to please take care of that orphan baby.",,"{"" "":1,"","":5,""."":17,""A"":1,""As"":3,""But"":1,""By"":1,""Chaplin"":2,""Charlie"":7,""He"":2,""In"":1,""It"":1,""Once"":1,""She"":1,""So"":1,""The"":1,""Therfore"":1,""This"":1,""a"":9,""able"":1,""about"":1,""afterwards"":1,""again"":3,""an"":3,""and"":5,""as"":3,""at"":1,""baby"":15,""back"":2,""be"":1,""before"":1,""besides"":1,""bins"":1,""by"":1,""can"":1,""care"":1,""cigarette"":1,""consequence"":1,""cought"":1,""could"":2,""crossed"":1,""disperately"":1,""doing"":1,""done"":1,""down"":2,""encounters"":1,""failed"":1,""finding"":1,""finds"":1,""first"":1,""flees"":1,""floor"":1,""for"":1,""found"":1,""gives"":2,""ground"":1,""had"":5,""hand"":1,""he"":12,""her"":3,""him"":3,""hits"":1,""ho"":1,""idea"":1,""identify"":1,""in"":3,""is"":4,""it"":6,""its"":1,""layed"":2,""laying"":1,""letter"":1,""lighting"":1,""man"":2,""mocking"":1,""more"":1,""mother"":1,""move"":1,""movie"":1,""no"":1,""not"":2,""notices"":1,""now"":1,""of"":5,""officer"":1,""old"":1,""olderly"":1,""on"":2,""one"":2,""option"":1,""orphan"":2,""other"":2,""out"":2,""over"":1,""parents"":2,""passing"":1,""pick"":1,""place"":2,""please"":1,""put"":1,""puts"":1,""realises"":1,""right"":1,""ruse"":1,""says"":1,""searching"":1,""see"":1,""sees"":2,""sequence"":1,""she"":1,""short"":1,""small"":1,""so"":3,""started"":1,""stroller"":6,""suddenly"":1,""suggested"":1,""suggests"":1,""take"":2,""that"":4,""the"":24,""then"":1,""thinking"":1,""this"":1,""to"":7,""turned"":1,""umbrella"":1,""up"":2,""was"":1,""way"":1,""where"":1,""which"":2,""with"":4,""woman"":3}","{""ADJ"":9,""ADP"":29,""ADV"":17,""AUX"":12,""CCONJ"":6,""DET"":42,""NOUN"":48,""NUM"":1,""PART"":7,""PRON"":33,""PROPN"":10,""PUNCT"":22,""SCONJ"":11,""SPACE"":1,""VERB"":43}","The,DET,short,ADJ,movie,NOUN,is,AUX,about,ADP,Charlie,PROPN,Chaplin,PROPN,finding,VERB,a,DET,baby,NOUN,and,CCONJ,searching,VERB,for,ADP,its,PRON,parents,NOUN,.,PUNCT,In,ADP,the,DET,first,ADJ,sequence,NOUN,one,PRON,can,AUX,see,VERB,Charlie,PROPN,Chaplin,PROPN,lighting,VERB,a,DET,cigarette,NOUN,.,PUNCT,By,ADP,doing,VERB,so,ADV,he,PRON,suddenly,ADV,notices,VERB,a,DET,baby,NOUN,besides,SCONJ,the,DET,bins,NOUN,on,ADP,the,DET,ground,NOUN,.,PUNCT,He,PRON,is,AUX,not,PART,able,ADJ,to,PART,identify,VERB,the,DET,parents,NOUN,of,ADP,the,DET,baby,NOUN,.,PUNCT,As,SCONJ,he,PRON,sees,VERB,a,DET,woman,NOUN,passing,VERB,by,ADV,with,ADP,a,DET,stroller,NOUN,,,PUNCT,he,PRON,suggests,VERB,that,SCONJ,it,PRON,could,AUX,be,AUX,the,DET,mother,NOUN,of,ADP,the,DET,baby,NOUN,.,PUNCT,So,ADV,he,PRON,layed,VERB,the,DET,baby,NOUN,in,ADP,to,ADP,the,DET,stroller,NOUN,.,PUNCT,It,PRON,turned,VERB,out,ADP,that,SCONJ,it,PRON,was,AUX,not,PART,her,PRON,baby,NOUN,.,PUNCT,As,ADP,a,DET,consequence,NOUN,she,PRON,started,VERB,mocking,VERB,at,ADP,Charlie,PROPN,,,PUNCT,so,ADV,he,PRON,had,VERB,to,PART,take,VERB,it,PRON,out,ADP,of,ADP,the,DET,stroller,NOUN,again,ADV,.,PUNCT,As,SCONJ,he,PRON,had,VERB,no,DET,other,ADJ,idea,NOUN,where,SCONJ,to,PART,place,VERB,down,ADP,the,DET,baby,NOUN,,,PUNCT,he,PRON,layed,VERB,it,PRON,back,ADV,to,ADP,the,DET,place,NOUN,he,PRON,found,VERB,the,DET,baby,NOUN,.,PUNCT,But,CCONJ,this,DET,move,NOUN,failed,VERB,again,ADV,.,PUNCT,A,DET,officer,NOUN,cought,VERB,him,PRON,laying,VERB,down,ADP,the,DET,baby,NOUN,on,ADP,the,DET,floor,NOUN,so,SCONJ,he,PRON,had,VERB,to,PART,pick,VERB,up,ADP,the,DET,baby,NOUN,again,ADV,.,PUNCT,Once,ADV,more,ADJ,he,PRON,is,AUX,disperately,ADV,thinking,VERB,of,ADP,an,DET,other,ADJ,option,NOUN,.,PUNCT,He,PRON,encounters,VERB,an,DET,old,ADJ,man,NOUN,,,PUNCT,which,PRON,he,PRON,could,AUX,hand,VERB,over,ADP,the,DET,baby,NOUN,with,ADP,a,DET,ruse,NOUN,and,CCONJ,flees,VERB,right,ADV,afterwards,ADV,.,PUNCT,This,DET,olderly,ADJ,man,NOUN,then,ADV,sees,VERB,the,DET,woman,NOUN,with,ADP,the,DET,stroller,NOUN,,,PUNCT,and,CCONJ,puts,VERB,it,PRON,in,ADP,the,DET,stroller,NOUN,as,SCONJ,Charlie,PROPN,had,AUX,done,VERB,before,ADV,.,PUNCT,Therfore,VERB,the,DET,woman,NOUN,suggested,VERB,Charlie,PROPN,the,DET,one,NUM,ho,PROPN,had,AUX,put,VERB,the,DET,baby,NOUN,in,ADP,her,PRON,stroller,NOUN,as,SCONJ,Charlie,PROPN,crossed,VERB,her,PRON,way,NOUN,.,PUNCT,She,PRON,hits,VERB,him,PRON,with,ADP,a,DET,umbrella,NOUN,and,CCONJ,gives,VERB,him,PRON,back,ADV,the,DET,baby,NOUN,.,PUNCT,Charlie,PROPN,gives,VERB,up,ADP,and,CCONJ,now,ADV,realises,VERB,that,SCONJ,it,PRON,is,AUX, ,SPACE,an,DET,orphan,NOUN,baby,NOUN,as,SCONJ,he,PRON,finds,VERB,a,DET,small,ADJ,letter,NOUN,which,PRON,says,VERB,to,PART,please,AUX,take,VERB,care,NOUN,of,ADP,that,DET,orphan,NOUN,baby,NOUN,.,PUNCT"

He thought the baby belongs to her so he puts him in the stroller. The mother gets upset telling him to take his baby back. So he took the baby back and placed it right where he found him but this time a police officer walks by. He takes the baby again back and walks around with him until he finds another person. He gives the baby in his arms and runs away. The guy with the baby finds the mother with the stroller as well and so he puts the baby in it and walks away. Charles now randomly walks by the baby carriage as the mother sees the random baby in it again. She hits Charles a few times and force him to take the baby out by speaking to the police officer. So he picks the baby back up and sits at a roadside. There he finds a paper which was hidden in the clothing of the baby.

First, he tries to put it in a stroller with another baby, but gets yelled at by the mother. Then he wants to put it back where he found it, but a police officer sees him. And lastly, he gives it to an old man and flees. After his attempt to follow Chaplin, the old man puts the baby in the same stroller in that Chaplin layed it before while the mother was not looking.

Chaplin,written_online,20,Outside classroom,Bilingual dictionary (Spanish/English),"At the beginning of the scene, Chaplin appears walking through a street, and he does not seem very worried. He goes under a window where a man is throwing something that provoques some dust, this is ignored by the protagonist. He keeps on walking and while he grabs his flexible walking stick, a lot of rubbish coming from above him, falls over Charlie making him dirty and also scaring him. Then he decides to take his gloves off and throwing them to the rubbish and to smoke a cigarette he took from a metallic box that he had in his pocket. It is then when he finds out there is a baby left on the street's floor crying, so he decides to get the baby and see if he can solve this problem. Chaplin starts looking around and then suddenly sees a woman with a baby car who seems to be looking for something, this makes him thiink it is the baby's mother. When he gets close and gives the baby to the woman, he finds out that he is confused and that the baby does not belong to that woman. After trying to leave the baby back to where he found it, a police walks in the place and make him get the child again. This leeds our protagonist to do what he does next, to fool a man he sees in the street and to give him the baby. This new man does not know what to do and as he sees a baby car with an empty place, he decides to leave the baby there. Yes, it was the first woman's baby car and unfortunately, she comes of the establishment she is in, coinciding with Charlie again, so she thinks this time it was him too who is trying to deceive her. Finally, Chaplin finds himself one more time with the child and after considering the option of leaving him, he observes a paper into the baby's clothes that says to love and to take care of that

He kept on walking smoking a cigarrette by the way he found a 2-month baby lying on the floor. He took the baby and looked for someone to take care of, so he saw a woman with another baby and tried to deliver him to her, although that woman wasn't his mom so she didn't accept the kid. <br/> In fact, the woman hit him on the back because she thought he was kidnapping her baby. <br/> He took off the baby and went to the corner where he found the baby and came to left him there, but a policeman watched him and he had to runaway with the baby. Some meters after that, another man walking on the street and Chaplin didn't lose the chance, he tried to give this man the problem..and the real problem came now, whe this new man tried to deliver the baby to the same woman as Chaplin tried before. Then, Chaplin kept on his walk and he watched that woman again..she run to him from his back and hit him again on the head, she left him with the baby and leave the scene.

He came up with the idea of giving it to the woman he saw a little after, since she was carrying her baby in a baby buggy, but the woman rejected inmediatedly due to the fact that that child was not her baby. Then, he was going to place the baby in the same spot he was found but a policy agent was watching him, so he could not. After that, he came up with the idea of giving it to a strange with the following excuse ""can you hold my baby for a second please?"". Surprisingly, he could get rid of the baby, but it was just for a minute, since the strange placed the baby in the same baby buggy that Chaplin did, so the woman hit Chaplin several times as soon as she saw him again. Finally, Chaplin had to get the baby out of there and when he was far enough he planned to throw it to the sewage.

He is cunningly treating a really serious and tragic topic through a humoristic sketch. At Chaplin's time, many orphans were abandoned on the streets or in front of orphanage because their, normally, single mothers were unable to give them the life they deserve. In other cases, they abandoned them because they were not supposed to have children or those children were the result of a rape and that fact had to be hidden no matter what it cost. Some of the kids died and many others stayed their whole life in a place where they were not happy nor well-treated.

However, the baby wasn't hers, and as a result Chaplin was scolded by the lady and he decided to return the baby on the corner where he found him/her, but it was impossible since a policeman discovered him doing that. Some seconds later, an old man waslking in the street and Chaplin did his best to give the baby to the man, he was able to do that, but unfortunately the baby ended up on the lady's carriage and when the lady realized about that Chaplin was walking next to the carriage and she thought it was him again, so she hit him with an umbrella on the head.

Chaplin,written_online,10,Outside classroom,,"During a walk through an industrial area and while enjoying a cuban cigar, Chaplin suddenly gets hit by some bricks. By lighting a cigarette, he then discovers an abandoned baby on the ground, worried and after seeing a mum going for a walk with her baby, he thinks she had dropped the baby. Quickly and convinced that the baby belongs to her, he takes the baby to the lady. Nevertheless, the lady gets mad, rejecting the fact of being her baby. With him among is hands again, Chaplin tries to put him back where he had found him but, just before doing so, a police officer crosses by, scaring him from abandoning the child. Afterwards, he walks away from the officer and, by tricking an old man, he gets rid of the baby. Unluckily, the old man crosses the lady and leaves the baby in the lady's wheel without she realizing what was happening.

When Chaplin realises the issue he has, he tries to leave the child where he has found him a moment before, but, as soon as he does it, a policeman comes into the scene and he has to take the baby back. Then, he gaves him to a homeless and that man manages to leave the baby with the woman, as Chaplin has tried. Unfortunately, Chaplin is found by the lady, who gives the baby to him.

It begins with him walking down the street and getting hit by a trash bin, afterwards he complains about it to the person who has thrown him the bin and when he looks down to the flooor to point the rubbish he notices thaat there is a baby covered in matresses who has been abanoned. Then he decides that he has to pick it up to find out a solution. After this he sees a woman that is in the same street with her baby so he supposses that the baby he has just found on the floor must be hers and he gives it to her and leaves; as soon as he is leaving the woman starts screaming at him because that is not her baby so he has to take it again and find out another solution. <br/> Afterwards he sees what it looks like a homeless person that according to Charles is the perfect person to take care of the baby and he jokes him by asking to carry the baby for a second while he ties his shoes, but instead he starts running away and leaves the baby with this randome person. <br/> Later on there is a scene in which this person sees the previous woman that was with her baby again and he has the exact same idea of giving it to her assuing its hers, but in this case the woman does not notice and when she finds out the baby is again with her  she sees Charles passing by again and starts screaming at him. Thus Charles has to carry again with the abandoned baby. And in the last seconds of the movie we can see how Charles takes a note out of the matresses's baby which says to take care of the baby",,"{""

Unfortunately, a police officer sees what he was doing, so Chaplin picks up the baby from the floor. Chaplin finds an old man on a walk and gives the baby to him.

He picks up the baby and starts to look for his parents. Charles thinks that he has found his mother but when he tries to give the baby to her, she refuses to take the baby. After that he come across a policeman and the policeman thinks that Charles is abandoning that baby. Charles stays with the baby looking for someone who can take care of him and he does so. He finds a stranger, tells him to hold the baby for a moment and he starts to scape from that stranger. The stranger, now in possesion of the abandoned baby manages to find the same mother that Charles found and tries to put the baby with her. The mother finds out that the abandoned baby is with her again and unluckily for Charles, who was walking in the same place as she was, the unknown mother gives Charles the baby again and he decides to stay with him. Finally, he sits somewhere else with the baby and he finds a note inside the baby clothes.

Chaplin,written_online,17,Outside classroom,,"One day, Chaplin is walking down the street, smoking, and checking his clothes are looking good. Neighbours are throwing rubbish from their windows, falling on him. All of a sudden, Chaplin finds a little baby on the ground and he picks him up. He wonders why the baby is there alone and sees a lady walking by with another baby. He runs to place the abandoned baby next to the lady’s kid. However, she realises it and he has to keep the baby for himself.  <br/> After that, he decides to leave him on the ground again, but a police officer catches him doing it and he has to keep him. Next, Chaplin gives the baby to an old man walking down the street and starts running away. The old man gives the little baby to the very same woman to whom the baby was given before.

The main character is rolled by Charles Chaplin, one of the best actors in black and white films. The story starts when Chaplin finds the baby crying on the floor behind a paper bin. Obviously, he takes the baby and tries to calm him or her. However, after a while, he realizes that people are going to say that it’s his baby, and he tries to put in a baby carriage of a foreign woman that was buying in a supermarket. The woman realizes what he has done just in the last moment, and she gives the baby back to him. Then, he tries the same experiment with a poor man that was also walking down the street, but this time he hides behind a wall, and the poor man puts again the baby in the baby carriage of the foreign lady. Unfortunately, when the woman realizes that the baby is in her baby carriage again, Chaplin is just walking near her, and she runs after him to hit him with her umbrella and returns him back. Finally, Chaplin decides to take care of the baby, he writes something on a paper, and the story ends with him seated on the ground.",,"{"","":15,""."":9,""Chaplin"":4,""Charles"":1,""Finally"":1,""However"":1,""Obviously"":1,""The"":4,""Then"":1,""Unfortunately"":1,""a"":10,""about"":1,""actors"":1,""after"":2,""again"":2,""also"":1,""and"":9,""are"":1,""baby"":11,""back"":2,""behind"":2,""best"":1,""bin"":1,""black"":1,""but"":1,""buying"":1,""by"":1,""calm"":1,""care"":1,""carriage"":3,""character"":1,""crying"":1,""decides"":1,""done"":1,""down"":2,""ends"":1,""every"":1,""experiment"":1,""films"":1,""finds"":2,""floor"":1,""foreign"":2,""give"":1,""gives"":1,""going"":1,""ground"":1,""has"":1,""he"":7,""her"":5,""hides"":1,""him"":7,""his"":1,""hit"":1,""in"":7,""is"":5,""it"":1,""just"":2,""lady"":1,""last"":1,""lost"":1,""main"":1,""man"":3,""moment"":1,""near"":1,""of"":5,""on"":3,""one"":1,""or"":2,""paper"":2,""people"":1,""person"":1,""poor"":2,""put"":1,""puts"":1,""realizes"":3,""returns"":1,""rolled"":1,""runs"":1,""same"":1,""say"":1,""seated"":1,""she"":2,""something"":1,""starts"":1,""story"":3,""street"":3,""supermarket"":1,""take"":1,""takes"":1,""that"":6,""the"":19,""this"":2,""time"":1,""to"":8,""tries"":4,""umbrella"":1,""video"":1,""walking"":3,""wall"":1,""was"":2,""what"":1,""when"":2,""while"":1,""white"":1,""who"":1,""with"":3,""woman"":3,""writes"":1,""’s"":1}","{""ADJ"":11,""ADP"":28,""ADV"":12,""AUX"":9,""CCONJ"":12,""DET"":36,""NOUN"":46,""NUM"":1,""PART"":6,""PRON"":29,""PROPN"":5,""PUNCT"":24,""SCONJ"":6,""VERB"":35}","The,DET,story,NOUN,of,ADP,this,DET,video,NOUN,is,AUX,about,ADP,a,DET,man,NOUN,who,PRON,finds,VERB,a,DET,lost,ADJ,baby,NOUN,in,ADP,the,DET,street,NOUN,and,CCONJ,tries,VERB,to,PART,give,VERB,him,PRON,or,CCONJ,her,PRON,to,ADP,every,DET,person,NOUN,that,PRON,is,AUX,walking,VERB,down,ADP,the,DET,street,NOUN,.,PUNCT,The,DET,main,ADJ,character,NOUN,is,AUX,rolled,VERB,by,ADP,Charles,PROPN,Chaplin,PROPN,,,PUNCT,one,NUM,of,ADP,the,DET,best,ADJ,actors,NOUN,in,ADP,black,ADJ,and,CCONJ,white,ADJ,films,NOUN,.,PUNCT,The,DET,story,NOUN,starts,VERB,when,SCONJ,Chaplin,PROPN,finds,VERB,the,DET,baby,NOUN,crying,VERB,on,ADP,the,DET,floor,NOUN,behind,ADP,a,DET,paper,NOUN,bin,NOUN,.,PUNCT,Obviously,ADV,,,PUNCT,he,PRON,takes,VERB,the,DET,baby,NOUN,and,CCONJ,tries,VERB,to,PART,calm,VERB,him,PRON,or,CCONJ,her,PRON,.,PUNCT,However,ADV,,,PUNCT,after,ADP,a,DET,while,NOUN,,,PUNCT,he,PRON,realizes,VERB,that,SCONJ,people,NOUN,are,AUX,going,VERB,to,PART,say,VERB,that,SCONJ,it,PRON,’s,VERB,his,PRON,baby,NOUN,,,PUNCT,and,CCONJ,he,PRON,tries,VERB,to,PART,put,VERB,in,ADP,a,DET,baby,NOUN,carriage,NOUN,of,ADP,a,DET,foreign,ADJ,woman,NOUN,that,PRON,was,AUX,buying,VERB,in,ADP,a,DET,supermarket,NOUN,.,PUNCT,The,DET,woman,NOUN,realizes,VERB,what,PRON,he,PRON,has,AUX,done,VERB,just,ADV,in,ADP,the,DET,last,ADJ,moment,NOUN,,,PUNCT,and,CCONJ,she,PRON,gives,VERB,the,DET,baby,NOUN,back,ADV,to,ADP,him,PRON,.,PUNCT,Then,ADV,,,PUNCT,he,PRON,tries,VERB,the,DET,same,ADJ,experiment,NOUN,with,ADP,a,DET,poor,ADJ,man,NOUN,that,PRON,was,AUX,also,ADV,walking,VERB,down,ADP,the,DET,street,NOUN,,,PUNCT,but,CCONJ,this,DET,time,NOUN,he,PRON,hides,VERB,behind,ADP,a,DET,wall,NOUN,,,PUNCT,and,CCONJ,the,DET,poor,ADJ,man,NOUN,puts,VERB,again,ADV,the,DET,baby,NOUN,in,ADP,the,DET,baby,NOUN,carriage,NOUN,of,ADP,the,DET,foreign,ADJ,lady,NOUN,.,PUNCT,Unfortunately,ADV,,,PUNCT,when,SCONJ,the,DET,woman,NOUN,realizes,VERB,that,SCONJ,the,DET,baby,NOUN,is,AUX,in,ADP,her,PRON,baby,NOUN,carriage,NOUN,again,ADV,,,PUNCT,Chaplin,PROPN,is,AUX,just,ADV,walking,VERB,near,ADP,her,PRON,,,PUNCT,and,CCONJ,she,PRON,runs,VERB,after,SCONJ,him,PRON,to,PART,hit,VERB,him,PRON,with,ADP,her,PRON,umbrella,NOUN,and,CCONJ,returns,VERB,him,PRON,back,ADV,.,PUNCT,Finally,ADV,,,PUNCT,Chaplin,PROPN,decides,VERB,to,PART,take,VERB,care,NOUN,of,ADP,the,DET,baby,NOUN,,,PUNCT,he,PRON,writes,VERB,something,PRON,on,ADP,a,DET,paper,NOUN,,,PUNCT,and,CCONJ,the,DET,story,NOUN,ends,VERB,with,ADP,him,PRON,seated,VERB,on,ADP,the,DET,ground,NOUN,.,PUNCT"

Chaplin,written_online,34,Outside classroom,,"Chaplin is walking by the street, close to some buildings under construction. Some rubble is falling from them and Chaplin avoids it. He approaches to the foreground of the image and some rubbles fall over him. He gets angry and yells at the people who are at the top of the building. He lights a cigarette but suddenly something catches his eye. There is a babe on the floor. Chaplin takes him and hesitates, he doesn't know what to do. A woman appears in the background pushing a baby carriage. When she is not looking, he puts the baby into the carriage. She notices and gets mad, yelling at him, threating him. Finally, Chaplin takes the baby again from the carriage and walks away.  <br/> A police officer approaches and stares at him inquisitively. Chaplin goes away because he doesn't want any problems with the authority. He asks a homeless to hold the baby for a moment but it is a lie and runs away. <br/> The homeless walks holding the baby until he finds a carriage (the one before). The woman who pushed it is inside a store, so the homeless takes advantage of the situation, puts the baby into the carriage.  <br/> Casually, Chaplin passes by there. The woman suddently exits the store and thinks that it was Chaplin who put the baby in the carriage again. She hits him and yells at him. The police officer approaches, but Chaplin walks away with the baby in his arms. <br/> In the final scene, he sits on the sidewalk holding the baby. He thinks about throw it in a sewer, but finally he decides not to do so. He finds some money among the clothes that wrap the baby and a letter that ask him to love the baby.

Chaplin,written_online,12,Outside classroom,,"At the beginning of the video we can see a man smoking, walking in a funny way and trying to avoid rubbish that someone is throwing away through the window. However, a second person hit him with the rubbish and annoyed, he begins to prepare another cigarette since the first one is now off. When he finishes, he finds a baby next to a bin and decides to take him. By chance, he finds a woman with another baby and goes to give her the baby he has just found, but the woman tells him to go away with him because the baby doesn't belong to her. After that confussion, the man tries to return the baby back to where it was, next to the bin, but a policeman discoveres him and he takes the baby and goes in another direction. Suddenly he finds another man and lies to him to take the baby because he is supposedly preparing his shoes, but runs away. This new man runs following the other and leave the baby just next to another baby, which is the same one from the woman at the beginning. When the woman comes out of the shop, the first man is passing by and she thinks that he tried to give her back the found baby again so she hits him.

Once he has insulted the last of these people, Chaplin lights a cigarrette. He throws his old gloves to the rubbish and, suddenly, he discovers a crying baby on the floor. He takes the baby and, while he was thinking that it had fallen from the buildings, he sees a woman with a baby car (with another baby in it). Chaplin gives her the baby, but she agressively refuses him. He is about to abandon the baby where he first found him, but a policeman catches him. Chaplin takes the baby again and this time he gives him to an old man with a long beard. Chaplin runs and hides on a corner. Curiously enough, the old man puts the baby on the woman's baby car, and when Chaplin is walking next to it, the woman discovers the baby. She gets angry and violently hits Chaplin with her umbrella, forcing him to take the baby away. The policeman arrives and Chaplin has to run away with the baby. He then sits down on the street and finds a note within the baby's clothes: ""Please love and care for this orphan child"".

Chaplin,written_online,10,Both inside and outside classroom,Bilingual dictionary (Spanish/English),"Charles finds a stranded child near some trash and tries to get rid of him as soon as possible. First he leaves it on a baby trolly with another child but the woman that is strolling it argues with him and tells Charles to grab it and go away. Then, he tries to leave the baby right on the spot he found it. However, a policeman stops him and intimidates Charles in order to pick up the baby. Sooner rather than later Chaplin turns left and locates an old homeless man and gives him the little child just to trick him. Running away, Chaplin hides himself from the old man. Nevertheless, this homeless man finds once again the same baby trolley of that women from before and leaves the child on it. In an unlucky turn of the events, Chaplin walks in front of that trolley only to find out that the baby is there and has to pick him up because of the rampaging behaviour of that mather and also of the previous police officer from before who threatens him. Later, in an exhauster condition, decides to seat in the sidewalk, just to come across with a note between the messy dirty bed sheet in which the baby was covered. ""Please love and care for this orphan child"".
